20,0,How do you stay interested in dating someone after getting to know them I ve seen a lot of advice for men is to ask any cute girl you meet out  or just as many as possible     My issue is that even when I m initially interested in someone  after a short conversation or just in general a short time after getting to know them  I lose all interest in dating them  This means that I never ask them out    I was wondering whether this is a somewhat common thing and how you stay interested in someone  I m unsure whether it s an issue with me or with the people I meet    I ve tried meeting people with common interests but even then I d just rather be alone after some time with with them    Edit    I m hetero romantic and asexual  In my case this means I m not motivated to have sex with anyone  and it s not something I d consider outside of a committed relationship     I m very introverted  so I find dating to be draining  especially with someone who I don t know well  This is why I prefer getting to know someone before I consider asking them out  Especially as in my age  at college  it s expected that you spend a lot of time with someone as soon as you start dating and I would find that very exhausting

48,0,Men  what dating advice could you offer to a female  I m on mobile so sorry about any grammar formatting issues   Okay so I ll start off with some background  When I was    years old I entered an abusive relationship with a    year old boy who I dated for almost   years  I finally broke up with him   years and    months later when I was    and even then he wasn t completely out of my life until I was about    and a half   With that being said  I m almost    and after receiving some therapy I am now finally taking an interest in dating again    But here is the dilemma  since entering that relationship until now   I really haven t really had many opportunities for interactions with men outside of minimal  platonic gestures    I ve gone on a few dates and I was either turned off by their immaturity  Lack of job  education  goals  ambitions  car  etc   Not that I expect someone my age to be established but I work full time  go to school full time  and live on my own  so I don t think it s unreasonable to expect that person to be on a similar path as me  Or they seem to be turned off by the fact that Im doing all of that  while they re  not  I d like to say  I have a quality personality and sense of humor  I m very kind and compassionate and I value having appropriate morals  And Id like to say I have features that Western society would define as attractive    So what I m trying to ask is how do I go about talking to men   Is it something I m doing wrong   I m not interested in dating apps and I work by myself so that limits me to meeting men at my community college social events    Is it weird for me to casually approach men   Suppose you were waiting for class and a female approached you and just started engaging in casual conversation  would that turn you off   What would you want that person to talk about  Are there independent men    What we re you looking for out of the female in terms of dating when you were in college

212,0,How intensely do you feel attraction to women in real life So maybe I m a  late bloomer  or something  but I ve only recently found myself  early    s  feeling physically attracted to men in real life  When I was a teenager I only had crushes on celebrities and fictional characters    I feel quite overwhelmed by a man I m acquaintances with  I don t want to date this man because I m not attracted to his personality  only his body  But it s just    wow  When I m with him I have to tell myself  don t look at his arms   make normal eye contact   listen to his  words  not just the sound of his voice       I guess I m used to the jokes about men trying not to look at women s cleavages and I m used to my female friends discussing what outfits are  appropriate  or not for certain events if they do don t want male attention  I m also used to guys being a lot more open talking about sex and who they find attractive at a younger age  My friends and I used to roll our eyes in high school because we just didn t feel any of those feelings    But I d always looked at men the same way I looked at other women so I don t think I ever understood what it meant when other people felt  attraction   I could tell  yes that man is handsome  etc but I wouldn t behave any differently around him  And as naive as it sounds  I didn t understand why going running in a tank top would make men behave differently or more likely to talk to me  I just thought   it s my boring body and I don t see anything sexual about it  Are these guys just being silly and playful teasing out of choice  Because it s fun to flirt   But I guess now I m starting to realise  The way I feel about this particular guy in my life when I see him shirtless is maybe how men feel about some other women and maybe even me   Considering the average male has a higher sex drive than the average woman  I suppose I m wondering how intense this feels for men  because it s leaving me in a bit of a frazzle  Let s say you re playing soccer with a girl who has an attractive body  What difference does it make what she wears  I mean  on a scale from naked to wearing a full tracksuit when does she start appearing distractingly attractive  Does this attraction disappear a bit if you are friends  Do you naturally start to ignore the attraction or is it something you actively try to decrease    TLDR  I think a dude is smoking hot and it s so intense  It got me wondering how intense other people have felt attraction to people they were not currently dating and how they deal with it     amp  x   B    amp  x   B

326,0,How to pace kissing official dating for a new girl I m no stranger to relationships  but this is the first time I m seeing someone in a very steady pace  Some background  I ve had two   year relationships  The first one was very long ago and in high school  so I don t remember much and it doesn t really apply to this one now  My second one was strange  We never really dated or went out  we met  had sex   weeks later  and just stayed together for a very long time  I got VERY used to basically being with someone all the time and being very close  intimate  and affectionate    I met a girl   weeks ago  and she s honestly perfect  I m not just saying that as many guys would say  but she s very intelligent  gets me  very respectful and has been raised very well I can tell  We are both looking for something serious  Since I never went though the whole  slow and dating and going out  phase  it s almost as if I m dating someone for the first time ever  We ve gone out on four dates and they ve all been wonderful  we went to a cute coffee shop  then I took her to my job to show her what I do  then I made her dinner and we went to the movies  and most recently just a study date since we both go to school  At the movies I finally made  a move  and held her hand  It s crazy how nervous I was considering I d already been through this and so much more before  I just don t know how soon is too soon to kiss her  and maybe officially ask her out as my girlfriend   I never did that before  but she s more traditional and hasn t really ever had a boyfriend before  I wanna take things slow but it s very hard because of what I ve experienced and been used to in the past  There s always that fear of rejection as well as  scaring  her away  just because there s some intrinsic things I was used to in terms of pacing  Our next date is on Thursday and we will be seeing an orchestra together  and I may get her some flowers  I felt like after four weeks of talking and these dates it would be a good time to maybe make it  official    but considering we haven t kissed yet I just don t know  
327,0,How much do big lips factor into a woman s attractiveness for men I feel like in the Instagram model kylie Jenner age  most girls considered beautiful have big full lips  if not naturally then through fillers  Fillers are wayyy more common than I thought  Not just in celebs but regular people  I know many people personally and I m not rich  and cosmetic enhancements are very good now so it s hard to tell often that it s fake  But is this something that straight guys actually desire in girls  or is it more for other girls that are interested in beauty and makeup    Edit  thanks for responses  but i feel like a lot of comments missed the point of what I was asking  I know most people don t like super fake looking lips  but e g even Blake lively has had her top lip done  and she would be considered having thin lips still  But whether if a girls lips are fuller  naturally or with good fillers  if that makes them more attractive

355,0,What is your criteria for asking out girls you are talking to on dating apps Personally  I won t be interested in going out with someone if they haven t actively engaged me in at least a little back and forth beforehand   If they aren t asking me questions  demonstrating some personality  and expressing curiosity for who I really am  then I feel like that is a good indicator of what a date with them would be like   When I match with a girl on an app  I m happy to initiate a conversation about something I ve found interesting in their bio or pictures   But  my typical experience is that  in the rare instance they actually respond in the first place  they might answer the couple of questions I ask and put no effort into creating an interaction with me   So  I decide this is a proxy for how they act in person and I have no desire to bother with trying to meet them   I feel like  if a girl is putting genuine intention and effort into it then that would be very evident and I would very much want to meet them   For what it s worth  I m    and interested in having a relationship with someone rather than just fooling around   My question for y all is  am I over thinking all of this   How do you guys gauge whether you actually want to go to the effort   and expense   of meeting up with someone   Do you have experience with asking girls out who might not have seemed especially interesting due to a perceived lack of effort when talking initially  only to be pleasantly surprised by how rad they were   I m preeetttyyy sure I m just over complicating the matter  but would love to hear what you guys think about it   Have a good one

403,0,Why am I inherently attracted to men if I m a man Like  I thought it was human nature for a male to be attracted to a female  but I feel so deeply attracted to other males  definitely not all of them  just a percentage of them that I find hot  that it feels so natural and instinctual to me  I just wonder how it is so engrained for me  Why sex between two males seems so  right  to me    I m not your typical  gay guy  with a limp wrist and sassy  flamboyant attitude  I know better than anyone that that stereotype only represents a small number of gay men  and I like women to a large extent as well  more romantically  But    sexually  I cannot  resist hot guys  And I don t know why    I was never attracted to them growing up  never thought I could be gay  never considered myself gay    but now    I mean  I guess I m pretty gay  I mean  men have been fucking other males for thousands of year  so maybe it is naturally engrained in us to an extent as well and we just don t embrace it as a society  Help me figure this out boys    Anyone else have similar feelings on the subject

408,0,How do you get over someone who doesn t like you back when you see them regularly Long story time   About a year ago I was out at a bar and my friend and I pursued a couple girls  We talked  we re having a great time and getting a little drunk  Well as the night is going on it is clear who is with who  but the problem was I had plans to get picked up by a recent Tinder hookup to go fuck  My drunken mind decided that I was risking not getting laid by sticking it out with this girl at the bar  lets call her Kate  and dipped out    Well fast forward however the fuck long    weeks idk  My friend and the girl he was talking to hooked up and now they re dating and I m seeing them regularly  I felt bad about what I did to her friend  explained to her and apologized and blamed it on my drunken stupor  Didn t really see Kate often but always played it cool and continued joking around with her when she was around  Then one night my friend group is going out  she tags along  I m nervous  drink too much  and come off as clearly way to into her  Not saying anything  but straight ogling over her when she s talking to me  Pretty much blew my chance there  and not to mention that my friend s girlfriend ended up telling her what happened the night they first met  This was before I had told her about my feelings for her so can t really blame her  it s her best friend   Then about a month ago my friend s girlfriend told me that  Kate  had completely planned on hooking up with me  But between ditching her then and coming off a bit too strong I had kinda blown it    Well now Kate met up with us last week at a bar and I continued just being myself  making her laugh etc  She decides to come out with our group again this weekend  Friday night she has a blast  saying it s the hardest she s ever laughed  wants to be in the group  and genuinely likes going out with us  Saturday comes around  we all go out again  We re all drinking and talking  me and her in a lot of one on one convos  We re all teetering on the edge of too drunk and my friend s gf and Kate go up and start flirting with these two dudes friend s gf was mainly playing wingman here   In my mind it was probably just being drunk and flirty whatever  but also sucks to see when you still have feelings for someone  We all end up leaving  those guys not included  and go back to my friends to crash  That night we re sleeping at my friends and we end up staying up until about      watching weird youtube vids together and talking  A great night with someone I truly like spending time with and think is potentially the most beautiful girl I ve ever talked to   But I      respect her decision not to pursue things romantically with me because of what I did in the past  I made poor decisions in the moment and would probably not date me as well if the roles were reversed  But I also want this person to feel comfortable in our friend group and to continue to come out with us  I just don t want to have that jealousy building inside me when we go out and she talks to another guy or if she starts dating or talking about other guys in front of me   I ve been mainly working towards bettering myself as a person  lifting  dropping some weight  reading  just trying to keep busy  But it s something that is always in the back of my mind  I want it gone or at least to the point where I don t have this jealous pit in my stomach  Have you guys gotten over this before or experienced something similar   TL DR  Met a couple girls a year ago  I ditch to go hookup with someone else  friend starts dating one of them  flash forward a year and the girl I talked to wants to be in our group  She was into me  now seems like she probably isn t  but I m still into her  Need help getting over her so she doesn t feel uncomfortable

528,1,If a guy proposed with a lab made diamond ring  but didn t tell you it was fake  how upset would you be Lab made diamonds are indistinguishable from real diamonds to the naked eye and can t be identified without lab equipment  The only way she would find out it was fake is if she brought it in for appraisal or attempted to sell it  If a guy bought a ring and told his SO it was real  so that she wouldn t be self conscious about it and could brag to her friends or whatever  is there really a problem     Edit  I see your point that this situation should ideally never come to pass because both parties would be on the same page  so let s say the girl is deadest on a diamond ring  but the guy just wants to save a buck   Or he s concerned about the human rights violations of the diamond industry  but let s keep our example as scummy as possible and just leave it as a financial decision      nd Edit  So as some people have pointed out  she would immediately realize when she got the ring appraised for insurance purposes  I never thought of that  Consider it cased closed   Also FYI  I m not getting married anytime soon and have a considerable disposition against the marriage industry  Hopefully I find someone as cool as all of you who feels the same
