Voting for March's book has now finished and the winner is **The Trial** by Franz Kafka:

&gt;A terrifying psychological trip into the life of one Joseph K., an ordinary man who wakes up one day to find himself accused of a crime he did not commit, a crime whose nature is never revealed to him. Once arrested, he is released, but must report to court on a regular basis - an event that proves maddening, as nothing is ever resolved. As he grows more uncertain of his fate, his personal life - including work at a bank and his relations with his landlady and a young woman who lives next door - becomes increasingly unpredictable. As K. tries to gain control, he succeeds only in accelerating his own excruciating downward spiral.

The first discussion thread for it will be on April 1st.",t3_b68n3g,1553715342.0,4,AskMen,"The AskMen Book Club: ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" Final Discussion Thread + March Book Announcement!"

[Edit] wow I just woke up, I'm absolutely blown away by how many of you have replied to this, I really appreciate it. I am reading everyone's comments but I can't reply to them all. Some of you have left very touching comments, stories  and suggestions which I will bare in mind.

Here are some of my dads interests; outdoors stuff such as hiking, cycling or golf, he also loves to cook and enjoys food alot and he likes to travel. Ideally I think the duration of the trip would be anywhere between 1-3 weeks. Some of you have already given me some great ideas which I'm looking into.

My issue is that even when I'm initially interested in someone, after a short conversation or just in general a short time after getting to know them, I lose all interest in dating them. This means that I never ask them out.  
I was wondering whether this is a somewhat common thing and how you stay interested in someone? I'm unsure whether it's an issue with me or with the people I meet.  
I've tried meeting people with common interests but even then I'd just rather be alone after some time with with them.  
Edit:  
I'm hetero-romantic and asexual. In my case this means I'm not motivated to have sex with anyone (and it's not something I'd consider outside of a committed relationship).  
I'm very introverted, so I find dating to be draining, especially with someone who I don't know well. This is why I prefer getting to know someone before I consider asking them out.

48,"(I’m on mobile so sorry about any grammar/formatting issues)

Okay so I’ll start off with some background. When I was 14 years old I entered an abusive relationship with a 16 year old boy who I dated for almost 3 years. I finally broke up with him 2 years and 11 months later when I was 17 and even then he wasn’t completely out of my life until I was about 18 and a half. 
With that being said, I’m almost 20 and after receiving some therapy I am now finally taking an interest in dating again. 

But here is the dilemma, since entering that relationship until now - I really haven’t really had many opportunities for interactions with men outside of minimal, platonic gestures. 

I’ve gone on a few dates and I was either turned off by their immaturity (Lack of job, education, goals, ambitions, car, etc). Not that I expect someone my age to be established but I work full time, go to school full time, and live on my own, so I don’t think it’s unreasonable to expect that person to be on a similar path as me. Or they seem to be turned off by the fact that Im doing all of that, while they’re, not? I’d like to say  I have a quality personality and sense of humor. I’m very kind and compassionate and I value having appropriate morals. And Id like to say I have features that Western society would define as attractive. 

So what I’m trying to ask is how do I go about talking to men? 
Is it something I’m doing wrong?

I’m not interested in dating apps and I work by myself so that limits me to meeting men at my community college/social events. 

Is it weird for me to casually approach men? 
Suppose you were waiting for class and a female approached you and just started engaging in casual conversation, would that turn you off? 
What would you want that person to talk about?
Are there independent men?

"" Me being tipsy,  I don't see this as a red flag,  and go off to explain to him how I like to socialize with other people etc.... He seems annoyed,  and keeps going on and on trying to make me feel bad, he goes I want to get you one of these hookahs,  he buys me this hookah thing to impress me,  I am sitting there feeling guilted into staying there with him by him buying that,  I almost felt sorry how desperate he was,  he asked me to go out to say bye,  I went and said bye,  he then started begging me to go home with him,  I said no,  he started taking out his ID,  showing me his name etc... Saying I can keep that so I feel safe,  then taking his key out saying I can keep the key,  I said no and went back inside,  I told the group I was in what was going on, he followed me in after a while,  and one of them stood up for me,  telling him to leave me the hell alone,  he kept pushing past him,  pleading and begging me to go home with him,  he kept shouting my name,  saying please,  please,  here is my key,  look my ID please,  the person trying to be a barrier between us said I will get the bouncer,  leave her alone,  he wouldn't stop and begged me for at least a hug,  I stupidly gave in,  cause of how desperate he was. He almost ended up crying, It was horrible,  for some reason I ended up feeling guilty when all I did was protect myself.

Another time I went on this date,  it was fun, but I had enough and said I am leaving,  he said he would walk me out,  the whole time I was waiting he tried everything to convince me to go home with him, he kept saying look at me and actually grabbed my arm trying to pull me in the direction of his place, he refused to leave me alone to wait for my taxi,  and said he would leave once I get in the taxi,  the night took such a bad tone then.  

I naturally have a friendly,  outgoing,  positive way about me,  and don't feel I should change that and become someone else?  Yet these men seem to take that as I am going to try sleep with her?  And if she doesn't I will make her so uncomfortable, and ruin her night?  How do I handle a situation like this in future,  will I directly go up to a bouncer or barman and say the situation?

164,"Hi. I just turned 20 so yeah I can consider myself as adult but I've never been in a relationship before and is hoping that if so happens it will be around my age bracket but so far, I dont see men around my age getting my attention but instead older men. They are not that old OLD but around 7 to 10 years older than me. Three are professors in my uni and others are some of my father's colleagues in their firm. I didnt notice it but people around me do. I'm baby-faced(?) and dont look my age tbh...just not matured looking so does that mean they are attracted on young YOUNG girls?? Isnt that just... hmmm? I dont think its my personality cos i treat older people like... older people? Im the youngest in the family so I'm used to treat people like an older brother or sister. Sorry if this was a stupid question I just wanted it to stop cos it feels weird attracting such... audience when I literally do nothing to get their attention. If I know what I unconsciously do that attracts them perhaps I could stop doing it.

189,"In my class (m18), there‘s a girl (A), I‘ve been good friends with for years. 
For 3 years she‘s been with another guy in my class.
The last few weeks she‘s been telling me about their relationship problems and how bad he makes her feel.
So two days ago we talked for over an hour.
A is completely crushed and it hurts me to see her like that. 
After our talking I got the hunch he might be emotionally abusing her.

Whenever both are in the same room, A wants to talk to him, have his attention, but he is extremly distant and just does not ever talk to her. She showed me texts, where she asked him whats up and why he doesn‘t wanna talk to her (for A doesnt want to argue in front of others)
And her boyfriend just straight up insults her, telling her to shut up.

One thing that really concerns me ist that she told me that her boyfriend hit her. (About two times) 
And (he is a very distanced calm guy) that he would often get really really angry with her and have a blast and when she cries he shouts at her to shut up.

Now I don’t want this girl to be so unhappy so I‘ve been there for her the last few days.
Her boyfriend got wind of that and now probably nows A told me some things.
(Whitch he of course does not like at all)

What goves me a bad feeling however is that I am now cought up in their relationship issues and I dont mean to intrude things that are no business of mine.
Which is actually pretty hard because when A is deavastated and asks me for help, I got to do something.
Im just unsure how far I have the right to jugde their relationship.

I just don’t think that it will get any better, because her boyfriend absolutely refuses to talk about their issues and gets angry when she wants to talk about it.
Also I‘m afraid he might hit her again.
And I cant stand whatching her being so crushed by him, for she means a lot to me.

Thank you for reading this far!(Sorry for the long text)

212,"So maybe I'm a 'late bloomer' or something, but I've only recently found myself (early 20's) feeling physically attracted to men in real life. When I was a teenager I only had crushes on celebrities and fictional characters. 

I feel quite overwhelmed by a man I'm acquaintances with. I don't want to date this man because I'm not attracted to his personality, only his body. But it's just....wow. When I'm with him I have to tell myself 'don't look at his arms...make normal eye contact...listen to his /words/ not just the sound of his voice...' 

I guess I'm used to the jokes about men trying not to look at women's cleavages and I'm used to my female friends discussing what outfits are 'appropriate' or not for certain events if they do/don't want male attention. I'm also used to guys being a lot more open talking about sex and who they find attractive at a younger age. My friends and I used to roll our eyes in high school because we just didn't feel any of those feelings. 

But I'd always looked at men the same way I looked at other women so I don't think I ever understood what it meant when other people felt 'attraction'. I could tell 'yes that man is handsome' etc but I wouldn't behave any differently around him. And as naive as it sounds, I didn't understand why going running in a tank top would make men behave differently or more likely to talk to me. I just thought...it's my boring body and I don't see anything sexual about it? Are these guys just being silly and playful/teasing out of choice? Because it's fun to flirt?

But I guess now I'm starting to realise. The way I feel about this particular guy in my life when I see him shirtless is maybe how men feel about some other women and maybe even me.

Considering the average male has a higher sex drive than the average woman, I suppose I'm wondering how intense this feels for men, because it's leaving me in a bit of a frazzle. Let's say you're playing soccer with a girl who has an attractive body. What difference does it make what she wears? I mean, on a scale from naked to wearing a full tracksuit when does she start appearing distractingly attractive? Does this attraction disappear a bit if you are friends? Do you naturally start to ignore the attraction or is it something you actively try to decrease? 

TLDR; I think a dude is smoking hot and it's so intense. It got me wondering how intense other people have felt attraction to people they were not currently dating and how they deal with it?

His laugh, the way he talks (He is a British person like me so its not a language barrier, but he is a southerner and I am a northerner) the way he walks, the way he acts. 

And I know this is going to sound horrible, but he eats really loudly, like he sucks the food dry or something whilst its in his mouth, its disgusting. 

Example: First time my sister brought him back to the house to meet the family, he walks around all arrogantly, sticking his chest out and doing what he wants. 

The reason I am so annoyed with him is because he think he is such a big man, he is arrogant because he thinks he can handle every situation.

He is 5’9, probs about 160kg and used to do some amateur fighting, terrible defense and his offense isnt great (saw one of his fighting videos and training videos, terrible form). Doesn’t really work out or keep himself in good condition.

We began spending more and more time together, we had a lot of common friends, we went together on trips with other friends, shared hobbies...

Two months ago he messaged me drunk asking for help with something. I offered help and asked him if he got home safely. No response. Two months later - still not a word from him. He’s alive and fine - other friends have seen him at a bar and at a club with other people.

I have decided to stop texting and pushing the person in any way. Clearly, if they do not feel the need to be in touch, I will not intrude. Basically, I have decided to let go, as hard as that may be...

311,"When I was a freshman in high school, there was this girl in my class whom I had a pretty big crush on. I sat behind her in science class, and occasionally we would make small talk about stuff. When spring rolled around, we both joined our school's track team. We talked a little more during this time, and I built up the courage to ask her out. She said yes, and I was stoked.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to the weekend, and we decided to go ice-skating at this indoor rink. We talked and laughed the whole time, and at one point I grabbed her hand and we skated together (I know, this post should have an NSFW tag). The date went really well, and her parents dropped me off at home later on. I was really into this girl and looked forward to spending more time with her.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this girl was seen as rather ""quirky"" and ""nerdy"" in our school, and I had other guys in my ear saying stuff and getting in my head. For whatever reason, dumb freshman me let their opinions get to me, and I ended up basically ghosting this girl. It was one of my biggest regrets throughout high school. I talked to her a few months later about it and apologized for how I had left things hanging. I felt terrible for it, and I knew she was really upset with me. I attempted to make up for my mistakes and asked her out again, hoping for a second chance, but she said she was always busy and couldn't. I knew she was too nice to flat out reject me, but I got the message. I deserved it.

The problem is a lot of my anxiety stems from gut issues I have and the random pains they create in my chest. And everything was magnified after my father had a heart attack and a round of sickness for me.

Furthermore, being alone for an extended period of time ratchets my anxiety up a couple of magnitudes. I rent from my parents, and they've gone 600 miles away for the week. So I'm by myself, which I don't like in the first place. 

The meds and talking about my anxiety seem to help, but what else can I do to help myself. I am seeing a GI doc to try getting my gut under control. But what else can I be doing?

326,"I’m no stranger to relationships, but this is the first time I’m seeing someone in a very steady pace. Some background, I’ve had two 3 year relationships. The first one was very long ago and in high school, so I don’t remember much and it doesn’t really apply to this one now. My second one was strange. We never really dated or went out, we met, had sex 2 weeks later, and just stayed together for a very long time. I got VERY used to basically being with someone all the time and being very close, intimate, and affectionate. 

I met a girl 4 weeks ago, and she’s honestly perfect. I’m not just saying that as many guys would say, but she’s very intelligent, gets me, very respectful and has been raised very well I can tell. We are both looking for something serious. Since I never went though the whole “slow and dating and going out” phase, it’s almost as if I’m dating someone for the first time ever. We’ve gone out on four dates and they’ve all been wonderful, we went to a cute coffee shop, then I took her to my job to show her what I do, then I made her dinner and we went to the movies, and most recently just a study date since we both go to school. At the movies I finally made “a move” and held her hand. It’s crazy how nervous I was considering I’d already been through this and so much more before. I just don’t know how soon is too soon to kiss her, and maybe officially ask her out as my girlfriend ? I never did that before, but she’s more traditional and hasn’t really ever had a boyfriend before. I wanna take things slow but it’s very hard because of what I’ve experienced and been used to in the past. There’s always that fear of rejection as well as “scaring” her away, just because there’s some intrinsic things I was used to in terms of pacing. Our next date is on Thursday and we will be seeing an orchestra together, and I may get her some flowers. I felt like after four weeks of talking and these dates it would be a good time to maybe make it “official” , but considering we haven’t kissed yet I just don’t know.

I have complete trust in her, and I am not in the least bit worried about her doing anything (and frankly, if I did, that would be a whole different problem).

When I match with a girl on an app, I'm happy to initiate a conversation about something I've found interesting in their bio or pictures.  But, my typical experience is that, in the rare instance they actually respond in the first place, they might answer the couple of questions I ask and put no effort into creating an interaction with me.  So, I decide this is a proxy for how they act in person and I have no desire to bother with trying to meet them.

386,"Hello all,
Been seeing my current GF for about 7 months and am entertaining the idea of moving in together. How can I lay ground rules down about expectations on both of our parts without seeming like a dick?
There is one red flag that I've noticed. 
She's still friends with one of her exes and he visits every now and then. 
Great guy, pretty chill, but that is still super sketch in my book. 
I don't want that to happen when we move in but I don't wanna seem like the guy that's mate guarding by banning him from our home. 

So how do I approach things like:
Respecting each other's wishes for alone time. (I love her but don't wanna be up each other's ass 24/7.)
Not inviting people over that we don't want there. (See above.)
Splitting costs 50/50. (She's earns less than I do but she's making it on her own as is. I don't want to turn into an ATM paying for everything. She's been super good about this so far except for one time. Not sure if that's an indication of future behavior. )
Chores. (I admit I'm bad at these things; how can I improve?)

If this belongs in another subreddit, please point me in the proper direction. 

Thank you for your time. 


UPDATE: Took the average advice posted and just talked to her a little while ago. We both talked about expectations and needs. She wants to move in faster than I do and was a little upset by this but we talked it out. She admits to getting caught up to comparing her life to her friends and feels like she's missing out. Also that she doesn't get to see me enough (we live 30+ mins apart) and feels like that's driving a wedge between us where I didn't feel that way at all and I let her know that. Overall a very positive outcome.

408,"Long story time.

About a year ago I was out at a bar and my friend and I pursued a couple girls. We talked, we're having a great time and getting a little drunk. Well as the night is going on it is clear who is with who, but the problem was I had plans to get picked up by a recent Tinder hookup to go fuck. My drunken mind decided that I was risking not getting laid by sticking it out with this girl at the bar, lets call her Kate, and dipped out. 

Well fast forward however the fuck long, 2 weeks idk. My friend and the girl he was talking to hooked up and now they're dating and I'm seeing them regularly. I felt bad about what I did to her friend, explained to her and apologized and blamed it on my drunken stupor. Didn't really see Kate often but always played it cool and continued joking around with her when she was around. Then one night my friend group is going out, she tags along. I'm nervous, drink too much, and come off as clearly way to into her. Not saying anything, but straight ogling over her when she's talking to me. Pretty much blew my chance there, and not to mention that my friend's girlfriend ended up telling her what happened the night they first met. This was before I had told her about my feelings for her so can't really blame her, it's her best friend.

Then about a month ago my friend's girlfriend told me that ""Kate"" had completely planned on hooking up with me. But between ditching her then and coming off a bit too strong I had kinda blown it. 

Well now Kate met up with us last week at a bar and I continued just being myself, making her laugh etc. She decides to come out with our group again this weekend. Friday night she has a blast, saying it's the hardest she's ever laughed, wants to be in the group, and genuinely likes going out with us. Saturday comes around, we all go out again. We're all drinking and talking, me and her in a lot of one on one convos. We're all teetering on the edge of too drunk and my friend's gf and Kate go up and start flirting with these two dudes(friend's gf was mainly playing wingman here). In my mind it was probably just being drunk and flirty whatever, but also sucks to see when you still have feelings for someone. We all end up leaving, those guys not included, and go back to my friends to crash. That night we're sleeping at my friends and we end up staying up until about 3:30 watching weird youtube vids together and talking. A great night with someone I truly like spending time with and think is potentially the most beautiful girl I've ever talked to.

But I 100% respect her decision not to pursue things romantically with me because of what I did in the past. I made poor decisions in the moment and would probably not date me as well if the roles were reversed. But I also want this person to feel comfortable in our friend group and to continue to come out with us. I just don't want to have that jealousy building inside me when we go out and she talks to another guy or if she starts dating or talking about other guys in front of me.

I've been mainly working towards bettering myself as a person, lifting, dropping some weight, reading, just trying to keep busy. But it's something that is always in the back of my mind. I want it gone or at least to the point where I don't have this jealous pit in my stomach. Have you guys gotten over this before or experienced something similar?

TL;DR: Met a couple girls a year ago, I ditch to go hookup with someone else, friend starts dating one of them, flash forward a year and the girl I talked to wants to be in our group.

For whatever reason (and to be honest I really can't pinpoint which since a lot happened the past few months) I developed premature ejaculation. I did not have that issue before and didn't even notice it until my girlfriend pointed out to me. It made me feel like shit and lost my confident even in things that are unrelated to sex at all.

I have to admit, my wonderful girlfriend stuck by my side through it all, she is the one who made me realize it's just a physical issue that can be solved with a little patience and some support.   


We're very communicative in terms of our sexual needs and wants, so I know she misses how things were before, which makes me feel worst sometimes, but mostly, I know she's by my side and I don't let it get to me as much as it used to, which also helped me to please her in other ways.

513,"So I know it may sound ridiculous, but for the past weeks I've been going through a really rough break up with my ex. She is moving back home to her family and then likely leaving the country. It really hurts, like a lot, but it is nothing I haven't been through before. It is going to hurt even worse once I realise what I have lost and all the other bullshit that comes with a break up.

The problem is that she adopted a dog before we started seeing each other and I pretty much helped raise her. This pup is one of the greatest creatures I have ever met and she is the sweetest, most beautiful animal ever. I seriously love this dog and she was there for me when I went through a serious bout of depression. I feel a serious bond with her, and now they are both leaving. A lot of times in the past when I went traveling or something she got really sad and would hang around my clothes or my motorbike helmet and cry, so she obviously will miss me too.

My man's fetish is cum. He loves me to play with it afterwards. I'm ok with it. Doesn't do much for me, but it usually can get me a second round back to back. It's not a gay thing, he says he wants me to worship his stuff.

Anyways, 

My fetish is cats. I know, it's weird. But I like to wear cat ears and do most on all fours. Not a bestiality thing, I like being treated like a pet.  I like a leash and to be talked to like I'm an animal. But he doesn't like it. He tries, but role playing is awkward for him and when he tries, he really struggles, and it always feels off. Its either akward or goofy. 
 He's a very manly man, and I don't think he's ever going to get off to my bad kitty needs.  He likes to fuck, and I have this specific, and admittedly odd kink.

518,"I’m a young guy (21) and have been working for the last 6 month in an office of 18 women (most of which are older and are moms but 4 of which are in their 20s which are the girls I’m teased about dating) and I’m one of the 2 guys. I don’t work much with the other guy but I don’t think he has the same issue. Basically over the last few months the moms seem to be trying to play matchmaker and get me to date the younger women in our office. I don’t have any interest in dating any of the women, whether they are my coworkers or not. 

The first was a new person, coworker A who I was training her and one of the moms told me that once me and coworker A start dating we have to let HR know as per office policy. I didn’t think much of it but it was pretty frustrating and made training A uncomfortable to me because it felt like the moms seemed to be watching and waiting for us to start dating or something. 

Coworker B is one of my closest friends in the office, she has a boyfriend and another one of the moms told me in a joking manner (a few weeks after the thing with A) that if B breaks up with her boyfriend I would be “stupid not to ask her out ASAP”. 

Coworker C is in her late 20s and one of the moms told me she hasn’t had a date in 3 years and that I should at least take her out for a drink. 

The latest was 2 weeks ago regarding coworker D. One of the moms told me that me and D would make a cute couple and that I should just ask her out already. 

These have all been with different moms prompting me each time. I don’t want to escalate it or make it a big deal but I wanted to see if anyone had any advice from a similar experience. In every case I’ve basically told them that I had no intention of dating any coworkers but I feel like they are just going to do it again since they haven’t taken me seriously the first 4 times. I like working here but it’s gotten to the point where I’m contemplating telling them I’m gay to make them stop.
