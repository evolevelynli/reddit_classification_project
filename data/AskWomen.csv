0,"**Welcome to AskWomen!**

In honor of the changing of the seasons and the influx of new users we see each year during the Spring/Fall Breaks, we wanted to welcome all of our new visitors and give you a quick and convenient refresh on the rules for this sub.

We know that there are a lot of different display options and apps out there for Reddit and some of those don't make finding the rules for each sub easy. Just in case you are using a view that doesn't highlight the rules, this post should help!

[Link to AskWomen Rules List](https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomen/wiki/rules)

If you ever have any questions about the rules, you can always message the moderators [here](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AskWomen).

&amp;#x200B;

**What is AskWomen's purpose?**

AskWomen is a subreddit dedicated to asking women questions about their thoughts, lives, and experiences; providing a place where all women can comfortably and candidly share their responses in a non-judgmental space. As part of our commitment to that mission, the AskWomen subreddit is curated to promote respectful and on-topic discussions, and not serve as a debate subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

**What should you do if you see rule-breaking content?**

There is a report button under each comment or post. If you see something that breaks the rules, please use the report button to tell us which rule you believe it breaks.

&amp;#x200B;

**What should you do if you have a questions about your comment or post removal?**

Message the moderators through the link in your removal message, the sidebar, or [here](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AskWomen) and include a link to the item you want to discuss.

&amp;#x200B;

**What should you do if you want to post a question that doesn't fit within the rules?**

We recommend trying /r/findareddit or /r/nsfw411 as these subs exist to help you find the perfect place for your Reddit post. Often, we will also give recommendations for specific subs that could help you in your removal messages. Please remember to read the rules for any sub before posting there.

&amp;#x200B;

**Does AskWomen have the same rules as other subs?**

Not really. Each sub creates their own set of rules based on their needs. The rules for AskWomen and for our affiliated advice sub, AskWomenAdvice, have a lot of similarities, but each has important differences that would make your question better fit in one or the other of them.

While we can provide a list of sub recommendations, we are not affiliated with any additional subs, so you would need to review their rules for participation as these rules may not be applicable.

**Quick image of what I'm describing:**

1. Professional/career driven woman who is on top of her work, organized, disciplined, working up the career ladder, commands respect, but is not overly aggressive. She is polite, well-mannered, hard working, and always seems to have her manners under control.  She may be starting a business or non-profit on the side.
2. Health: She has her health under control. She is rarely seen eating sweets. Drinks a lot of water, green juices, salads, and appears effortless about it as well. As if her habits have been carved in stone and nothing will undo it. And yet she can occasionally have a bite of a cookie and not seem to care about it much. She most likely does yoga, pilates, or some other form of exercise. She doesn't have the perfect body but she is healthy, at a good weight,  and appears happy with who she is.
3. Appearance: She always seems effortlessly fashionable in a subtle way. She knows exactly what to wear to everything. For her the attention is to the details, nothing is flashy. She also takes care of her skin. For an older woman like this, she is aging well and is comfortable and confident despite some wrinkles. Her clothes are always clean, ironed, well fitting, etc.
4. Charm: This woman is incredibly charming. Going back to her manners, she always seems to know what to say to make other people comfortable. She has an amazing smile and warmness to her that attracts people to her.
5. Relationships. This one is the most important because sometimes I see all of the above but this one is lacking. This woman has a fulfilling relationship with her partner and her friends. She can easily switch from office hardworking to relaxing and having fun. She takes care of the people she loves.  She commands respect. Although often I see these type of women tend to be careful with letting new people into their lives. Which can make it hard to get to know them, especially if you're not as put together as they are. I'm thinking they are very careful of the company they keep because of the saying, ""You are the people you spend the most time with.""
6. Hobbies/Talents: They build themselves up and enjoy life. They tend to have really cool hobbies they don't talk a lot about but that require effort. It's never Netflix. Some hobbies I've seen: creating a type of woven art and selling it, running a Networking club, environmentally friendly fashion and skin care, learning languages, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Each year I *meet* maybe 1-2 of these women. I might *see* more but I can only see their appearance and not the rest. They're incredibly rare and something I aspire to.

&amp;#x200B;

**How do these women do it? Do you know someone like this? How do you become more like this? What was your story becoming more like a well-put together career woman?**

&amp;#x200B;

*Note: I know a lot of people may say that it might be smoke and mirrors, sure these women have difficulties like everyone else but what separates them is that they don't unravel and they keep pushing forward.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Update: It looks like the comments range from, ""That's unrealistic, no woman is like that, it doesn't exist, its too strict. ""** 

**to**

**""that me and 98% of my friends, its not that hard but its basic adulting. It's a normal Tuesday for majority of women.""**
