1,0, meta  Think of the comments as an inverted Uber rating   click to find out what this means Since two or three times a week we end up removing a few threads on why everyone keeps suggesting breakups  rather than micromanage the community  we figured this post would be prudent   You know how every Uber rating is right on the verge of   stars unless something s particularly off  Everyone s all  A    WOULD RIDE AGAIN   Same for eBay  Amazon  etc   Well  think of  r relationship advice comments as much the same  only inverted  Two things to always keep in mind      The vast majority of people posting here are posting because they ve got a challenge they probably haven t been able to resolve on their own       In many cases  these challenges are insurmountable  or just exceedingly difficult to deal with       The majority of commenters aren t  necessarily  cynical assholes  but combine both a one sided account of what happened your account with each commenter s own potential history  grievances  etc   and the resulting brew is pretty dark    meaning that every post will get drenched in comments like  dump  and  lawyer up     The  key  is that the number of serious comments telling you to  consider an alternative to breaking up  is a good way to tell whether or not there s merit to continuing what you ve got going  Examples     Let s say you re asking whether a particular behavior is a red flag  and that behavior is so bad  the flag s not so much dyed red as it is  literally bleeding   Nearly every single comment will probably tell you to run  Cool    Zero Stars    Shoot I might even lock the thread and tell you it s above our paygrade     Together but your s o cheated on you once  Most comments will probably tell you to run because  once a cheater  always a cheater   Some comments might suggest you should stay and work it out  but the details of how the cheating happened might vary the number of these comments  Great    One or Two Stars       Married but your s o got drunk and made out with someone else  felt awful about it  immediately left the event where they met that other person and told you what happened and apologized with no prior history of cheating  Many people might  still  tell you to leave  same reason   but odds are good that equally as many people might tell you to consider staying  Awesome    Two  maybe even three stars       Good relationship with your S O but they forget to treat you in the love language you normally need to thrive  Maybe they forget to bring you token flowers trinkets or other signs of appreciation but otherwise everything s pretty good  Many comments will probably be advice on how to communicate  there ll probably still be a good number of downers but overall this would probably be in the   three to four stars territory       This amp nbsp is amp nbsp uncommon       Everything s rosey and you re looking for a way to celebrate your s o s special promotion  anniversary  birthday  or something else  Probably   four to five stars       This amp nbsp is amp nbsp uncommon     This applies to platonic  professional  and other relationships that aren t exactly romantic either  but for the sake of not needing a TLDR for the TLDR  I m avoiding listing every single condition  You get the idea   Basically  the people telling you to leave probably outnumber the people with less jaded opinions by an order of magnitude  so the best way to consider the advice is to see whether other advice shines through the background blackness of  break up with them   If everyone s telling you to break up  that s probably what you should do  but if     of the comments are telling you another way  you should definitely consider giving that     a chance   You get the drift           TL DR    The vast majority of comments will tell you to break up  It s a side effect of the fact that many people who subscribe either have a very dim view of relationships or just do it for the drama  The more people tell you to consider something  other  than breaking up  the more value there is in trying that other approach  whatever it is        Yeah  this is the kind of analysis that happens when a sub s been around for almost a decade  It s also long overdue considering we re at over    m subs and y all are always so grim  shrug       Comments open for    hours or less       edit  which is to say that we ll take feedback on this and whether there  should  be any changes to encourage people to be more positive with the advice they give    but honestly  we d rather not unless someone comes up with an exceedingly compelling reason  If you disagree with a downer  just downvote it     But if someone s being offensive with their remarks  rEpOrT it  Can t stress this enough   
2,0,My girlfriend    F  secretly took my    M  facebook password and started unfriending female friends So    my girlfriend tends to be sometimes jealous    She has gone through my classmates  female specifically  Instagram profiles just to find if I have liked any pics and I had to explain why I have done that in      messages long conversation   Had to explain myself for a day why one friend  female  commented on my pic on Facebook and why I liked her comment   Once had a   h fight about my friend s sister who offered to take me to her brother s party   Since we live in the same city and her brother lives h away    Also had a pretty big fight when she wasn t at my home but had my childhood best friend  female  over with her mother  since they are basically part of our family  and they were staying overnight  I brought my cat to their room so they could pet him but my gf was going on and on about how I did that just to be with my friend alone together   And finally  yesterday I found out that she has taken my Facebook password logged on her phone and every other day went through my friends list and unfriended old classmates  female only  or just good looking female friends of mine  I haven t talked with her since after confronting her about it    amp  x   B   I have to say after every each of these  and also some other jealousy moments I haven t written down here  she has been very sorry and apologized  She s a very loving and caring person and reminds me how much she loves me every day  at least    times   She even writes me letters from time to time and she really truly loves me just like I love her   But I just can t understand why she s so jealous because I haven t given her a single reason for her not to trust me like this  We have been together for more than a year now and these moments just make me think that all of this is not worth it since I can t see how can you build relationship without trusting each other and I don t want to spend my days looking over my shoulder just to see if I left my PC or tablet unlocked    amp  x   B   So am I just overreacting a bit or is this really strange  This is the first serious relationship for both of us and I am looking for some unbiased opinions  Thank you   
3,0,My    F  boyfriend    M  had a bizarre reaction upon meeting my sister    F   Neither of them will tell me what s going on and it s driving me crazy I ll get right to it  BF and I have been together for almost a year now and our relationship has been great so far  He s my dream guy and I honestly couldn t ask for someone better  I always felt that we were both honest and trusted each other  At no point in our relationship did I sense that he was being unfaithful or doing something he shouldn t    Last week he came over to have dinner with my family  My parents know him well and adore him  however it was the first time he met my sister  or so I thought   For the record  I don t have a great relationship with her at all  She s manipulative  aggressive and batshit crazy to put it mildly  The only time she contacts me is when she either needs   money or     my help to get her out of trouble once again  I don t have a clue what s going on in her life most of the time and prefer it that way     Anyway  after dinner BF and I were in one of the guest bedrooms when my sister walked in  she arrived late as usual   As soon as he noticed her his whole demeanour changed  He looked surprised but then very annoyed  It was obvious he was trying to act indifferent but it wasn t working at all because he absolutely lost focus of what he was doing  My sister s reaction was also weird  she immediately said  oh hey  in this fake innocent voice and started giggling  She had this huge fucking grin on her face and asked me where I  found  him  They awkwardly exchanged greetings and then she left the kitchen again    Of course I asked him wtf just happened  like do you know her or something   He vaguely said that she seems  familiar  and kept beating around the bush  I asked if they had sex and he immediately assured me that they  they definitely did NOT  hook up and that I shouldn t worry     Later that evening I asked her in private if they met before and did something I should know about  She wasn t being serious at all and kept telling me not to worry and all that BS  However she swore they never hooked up and I actually believed her for once  if they did have sex she d definitely rub it in my face  I asked her if she owes him money or something and she said no    Side note  As we were about to leave later in the evening BF said that he forgot his wallet and needed to go back inside  At the time I didn t realize but now I m almost sure he went to talk to her  for whatever reason    It s really frustrating being in this situation  and I can t stop thinking about it  I ve brought it up several times and he just keeps changing the topic or telling me that  nothing happened   Doesn t that sound crazy suspicious  I don t want this to affect our relationship but I feel like I don t even know him anymore  I m tired of begging for explanation at this point  Should I have a serious discussion with him or just give up  amp  move on       TL DR My boyfriend and my sister have met in the past  neither of them will tell me what happened  I m quickly losing trust in my bf and find it unfair that he s being so secretive  Should I give him a chance to confess everything or just move on    
4,0,I    f  dumped and blocked my boyfriend    m  for his comments about my neighbourhood I don t want anyone having the slightest clue about where I m from  so I ll be kinda vague    amp  x   B   I live in a very poor hood with a problem with gang related violence  It wasn t all bad  because there was also a community of people who loved and helped each other  It s home  Now that I m at a huge university in my city  I ve met people from all types of backgrounds  Of those people  is my boyfriend  who is from a well off family  He s never had to worry about making rent or pretending not to be hungry so your mom doesn t cry when your parents think you re sleeping  But I was taught not to talk about money  so we really never covered that  We really did love each other and he made me feel complete    amp  x   B   In my neighbourhood there is a small   establishment   that offers free   services   products   to kids who get good report cards GPA  That applies from elementary school and until the end of College  College kids who provide ID also get a crazy discount  Finishing high school isn t something super common  so it s a great way to reward us  The good grades thing usually stops after like  th grade  so it s a great way to encourage kids   It s like  in my HOOD hood and hasn t been  discovered  yet by any of those people who think relative poverty is trendy  I think they re too scared to come this far out lmao  It s super lowkey   I took my boyfriend to this restaurant and he was cool the whole time  He never seemed scared or judgemental  When we walked in  I was getting out my school ID  I explained to him the rule and how much it meant to me  He laughed  I asked him what was so funny   He said  They shouldn t applaud a fish for swimming   I asked him to explain what the hell he meant by that   He says that they re just giving out handouts for people who are doing the bare minimum  That getting good grades and going to school is an expectation  not something super revolutionary  I told him that IS where I live  It s not easy to stay in school  when nobody around you does   This started a huge argument   I asked him how many friends of his dropped out  he said none  I have    They were smart kids  but they got caught up in dumb shit  It s really easy to do that in my neighbourhood  My mom goes to a new funeral every week  Some of the kids I grew UP with are in jail right now  My mom STILL hides from me whatever the hell my cousins are up to  He said that giving the kids free stuff for something they don t deserve is like welfare  That there s  nothing impressive about NOT being a criminal  it s basic requirement for being a part of society   And that shouldn t get you free shit from a  ghetto ass   establishment       That this is why people get dependant on welfare   At this point I told him I was done  I didn t want to debate  I didn t want to talk him  Not then  not ever again  We just went out separate ways  I broke up with him as soon as I got home   He thinks it doesn t make sense for us to break up after something so small  That we re not going to be one of those couples that throws away everything over one conversation  I told him  yes the fuck we are  He s been trying to contact me but he s blocked on everything   I think I may have overreacted with the block  but I want him to leave me alone  I don t want to work it out   All my friends agree with me  but they ve lived in the same neighbourhood    I m not saying I HAVE to be with someone who s from my hood  But I have to be with someone who at least gets it  Especially when  it  has shaped who I am today  Idk what kind of person I am  but I think I might need to be in a relationship with someone who gets it  That  establishment  means a lot to me   Edit  I m sorry I wasn t clear  Should I let him reach out to me  I don t want to get back together  but should I unblock him and talk it out  I m worried that I ll fold and we might get back together  I ve seen my friends do it all the time  they always go back  I m worried conversation will make that happen to me 
5,0,Accidentally saw that my boyfriend bought a ringMy boyfriend and I have been together about   years  We ve talked about the future  live together  it s all been wonderful  We ve gone through some hurdles  but we re stronger than ever  We ve talked extensively on marriage  Somewhat already have a plan  even    I m sad I accidentally stumbled upon my boyfriends recent purchase  He was going into the shower and asked me to purchase our movie tickets online so we could go once he was out  His laptop was opened  but asleep  on his desk so I just hopped on there to do it quick  As soon as I turned it on  his email was up  I didn t think anything of it except I saw a  confirmation email  saying  Your BIG purchase is on the way     Thinking he bought another little toy of his  he likes to get random things to build and it can be costly   I clicked it to see what he got himself    I was so wrong  As soon as I opened it it listed out ENGAGEMENT RING with the specifications  not an image though thankfully i don t know what it looks like   The final price made me gasp  Almost    k  I can t believe it was that much  I feel so bad  I ve told him it can be minimal  I don t want him to spend so much on me  I m sure it s beautiful but I feel terrible he spent that much  He makes a good living  but that s for him  and our little family  but to spend almost         on me  I just feel bad he felt he had to do that    I can t tell him I know  but is there a way I can make it up to him  I just am lost on what to do here  I feel guilty he spent so much  
6,0,Am I being a psycho  Or do all boyfriends do this Sorry for the format  Mobile poster and a long story  Anyway  My boyfriend     and I     have been together two years now  We started off as just friends with benefits  Then we fell in love  I got pregnant  and we had a beautiful baby boy  He is an amazing father and takes great care of us  He even let me take off work for a year to spend with our son  which I will forever be grateful for  Everything was great    There s somerhing that really bothers me though  and Im not sure if I m being crazy or what  I developed severe antepartum depression while I was pregnant and postpartum depression  anxiety after my son was born  Basically I was a mess  This is when I really started to be bothered by these offhand comments he would make  even though he told me I was taking them wrong or he was just joking  Here s a list of some of the comments I can remember from the past year     At an emergency appt at the hospital since I hadn t felt the baby move in two days  He was referencing a girl he works with    You should do more squats or start lifting so your ass looks like hers  It s amazing  I get distracted when I m working on her machine     At his house  referring to the same girl   She asked me to come hang out with her sometime  I could ask if you could come too  Maybe she ll wear those booty shorts she has on Instagram all the time     When he told me that same girl got a boyfriend  Me   Yeah bet you re upset about that  Now you won t get to fuck her like you ve obviously been trying to  Him   Im not trying to fuck her  I would definitely fuck her though  She s got an ass for days    While looking at camgirls on Snapchat   You need to get a boob job so you have tits like hers  They re amazing      Replying to me expressing my distaste for my postpartum body    Ill fuck a girl with a subpar body as long as she has a cute face  like I do with you    There are plenty more  but this post is long enough  I would like to add that he also started watching camgirls  premium snapchats  and getting on tinder to find local camgirls  He would regularly describe what he liked about the girls he used to fuck  told me about  the hottest chick he was ever with   and would be messaging his last ex girlfriend about everyday  He still had nudes and sex tapes from his last ex and his old mistress on his Verizon account well into our relationship  It might be relevant to mention that he also was paying his ex girlfriends bills over a year after we got together    Is the depression making me crazy  Am i taking his comments wrong  Do all men do these things  Should I just shut up and be grateful for everything he s done for me  I honestly have no idea  Im not in a very good place mentally  I just don t want to come off as a psycho     Edit  I failed to clarify that I have told him how much these comments hurt me  several times  Almost everytime he basically dismissed me  Also  these comments seem to stop for a month or so after something serious happens  i e our son was in the hospital  I  regrettably  attempted suicide  i threated to move out    They always come back though im some form  
7,0,Please help      F  has just been told by my monogamous boyfriend     M  of   years that he wants a polyamorous relationship  He is blaming me for not being understanding  Am I in the wrong I am hoping I can get some clarity as to if I am in the wrong here  I have been with my boyfriend for   years  it was monogamous from the start  Recently  he brought a girl around who he said was a friend who he wanted me to meet  A few weeks later  he tells me that he wants a polyamorous relationship  That he is not capable of monogamy and has just been lying to himself to keep me happy  He made a comment about the girl from work and wanting to add her to our relationship  essentially date both of us at the same time   She told me via text that she is also interested in this and that they have known each other for months and have a  trust pact  and tell each other everything  including personal things about my relationship with him  He has been screenshotting our conversations and sharing them with her  When I asked for screenshots of their conversation  he refused because it was  too traumatic  for him to go through and that he deleted their messages anyway out of frustration  I became upset about this entire situation  as I have always been led to believe that we were monogamous and I feel blindsided by this  He broke up with me for not wanting to be in a polyamorous relationship  Both of them told me that I was being very selfish and immature and that I don t know what love really is  I just feel like he wants to hook up with this other girl and keep me around so that he can have his cake and eat it too    I really don t know what to think  Am I in the wrong here  What should I do 
8,0,My sister is dating a guy with the same name as me and it s causing issues My sister met Brad   years ago in college    months ago Brad moved to our hometown  Brad s full name is Brad Smith not his real name  My name is Brad and our last name is Smyth  I ve changed our last names  but they sound a bit similar    Any way  since he s moved we ve spent a lot of time together  He s a really great guy and I enjoy being around him  I think we re on our way to becoming best friends  He gets along with my friends  so it ends up being that he ll come and hang out with us on the odd Friday night    My sister didn t have a problem with this until   weeks ago  She liked that we got along and that I could see what she saw in him  Brad and I were together one day because my sister was out with some friends  We went out to pick up super smash bros because each of us claimed we could beat the other  While at the mall  we ran into my sister and her friends  After chatting for a bit we left  This conversation started all of our problems    Her friends had never seen Brad and I together before  When we left they commented how we re both tall with blonde hair and blue eyes  We also have similar senses of humor  They started to tease her that she was dating her brother    She called me over a few days ago when Brad was at work and asked if we could stop hanging out so much and how it is causing problems in their relationship  She explained what her friends said and how now she can t unsee it  I think it s a bit more like cousins  which obviously isn t much better  I didn t tell her this    Brad and I get along really well and I enjoy being around him but I also love my sister too much to interfere with her relationship  Especially when she s with a great guy  She had her conversation with Brad and we ve all agreed not to see each other until she s figured out a solution that works for her    I don t know what to do now  should I just wait to hear back from her or is there any solution that I can bring up    
9,0,I hosted my  M    brother  M    and sister  F    in law in my house  They were terrible guests  were disrespectful and broke our   rule  not to use our toilet  After their daughter clogged my en suite toilet flushing pads I asked them to leave  Now they ve pitied our family against us and want moneyMy wife s sister   her husband and two teenage daughters came over to stay with us for a few weeks while they re renovating their house    Our son is away in college so we put my nieces in his room  and my in laws in the attic which has a big sofa bed in it  There s no bathroom in the attic or in our son s room  but there s a bathroom in the second floor that they can all use    The problem we had is that none of them liked using the second floor bathroom and would only use my wife s and I en suite bathroom in our bedroom  We made it very clear from the first day that we have no problem with them staying over but there were some boundaries that had to be respected in order for us to get along and not get on each other s faces  We told them our bedroom and our bathroom were off limits because that s our private space  They ignored this and started using our bathroom    On the very first day I went use my bathroom and saw a shit floating in it  I let it go because I thought it was a mistake  But they kept using our bathroom and mistakes kept happening  We kept finding unflushed poops  unflushed pees and sanitary items inside the toilet    Apparently this is common for them  It kept going on for a solid week  My wife and I tried to keep the peace at home  We thought we had to be the bigger person and try to work it out so we could all be under the same room without murdering each other  But still  they kept using our toilet and denying it  When confronted they had the nerve to play the victim and say we were making them feel like they were a trouble for us and they d never disrespect our house rules    Yesterday one of my nieces calls me over and says something s up with our toilet that s clogged and I should fix it  I go over there and see   bloody pads clogging the toilet so I told her to pull them out  She started crying and screaming that I was abusing her because I was forcing her to touch something where everybody was doing their business  My in laws came running when they heard her scream and started saying what the fuck is my problem why can t I just pay for a plumber to come fix it instead of making their daughter do it herself    I reached breaking point and told them to get the fuck out  they aren t fit to live with others  they re fucking pigs for never flushing their shit and asked if they have a scat fetish and get off in my wife and I having to find their shit in our toilet  They got very offended and we got into a screaming match but I tried to collect myself  I had a stroke last year  and told them to just get the fuck out    Now the rest of the family is blaming me because they have to pay for a hotel for the   of them for at least   month until they can move back into their house  So apparently it s my fault they re gonna run out of money  Not that any of them is offering them their house though    Last night I sent my brother in law a text demanding he pays the plumber s bill for unclogging the toilet but he refused saying I kicked them out my house causing them to spend the rest of the little money they had in a hotel plus food for   people for at least a month  Not only that be he had the nerve to say I should reimburse him the money he has to spend in a hotel and food now because they didn t count with having to spend any money while they would have been at our house and this is setting them back a lot    In no world am I gonna pay him any money when his entire family is the ones who fucked up  Plus they ve pitied my wife s side of the family against us  particularly me   I ve been getting texts from them belittling me and telling me how horrible I am    I want to take it to a small courts claim out of principle  but maybe it d be taking it too far  My wife says it s time to go no contact with her family and I support her but I m afraid she might regret it in the future if she cuts out her whole family  Her family is not very all there but it s her family  How can we deal with this      TL DR   Extended family stayed over at our house  Broke our only rule which was not to come into our room and use our en suite toilet  Left their business there for us to see and had the cheek to deny it afterwards  Their daughter clogged my toilet and I lost it  I kicked them out my house and demanded they pay the plumber s bill  which they refuse since because of us now they don t have any money and in return want me to pay their hotel bill      Edit   Reuploaded with a new title because I realized the other title I used wasn t clear enough what was happening    
10,0,She     F  broke something I     M  built in my free time  I am still sad about this and having trouble moving past it TL DR at top  got into a huge argument with the wife  went out to do a chore she asked me to do  came back to a project destroyed  Feeling really sad and want to move past it    Most nights when my wife comes home  she doesn t even talk to me  She immediately gets on her phone and binge watches yet another series  She s able to live on far less sleep than me  so she can stay up for hours watching Netflix and I only really have    minutes or an hour where I m awake that we can do anything    I asked her what she s watching and commented that I wish I could be part of the shows she watches  or just offer occasionally to watch one of her shows with me  This gets into a huge  screaming fight where she tells me that I say she never does anything for me  I just keep trying to reiterate that she lives her whole life around binge watching and I m ok with her having her own thing  but it d be nice to be included occasionally   I had to run out and do a chore that she asked me to do because she was too tired  She called me when I was out and told me she broke something  I couldn t understand her and she wouldn t pick up the phone after she hung up on me    In my very limited free time between kids  work  and her  I was trying to build an enclosure for my  D printer  just to keep the heat in and the draft out  Nothing fancy  frankly it wasn t special  and all I did was the wood framing and I had the panels cut to attach to the sides and to make the door  But it was something I made  She smashed it with a hammer   I honestly wanted to cry  I know that isn t a manly thing to admit to  but life has been difficult lately  To condense it a little  I am not even remotely successful in my professional life  personal life  or family life  and it s depressing  These little projects are sometimes the only thing that makes me feel like I m doing something in my life correctly  Even if it s some small  relatively meaningless thing    It s the next morning and we re past the apologies at this point  and she  apologized  for that  but immediately said it should ve been something more valuable like the actual  D printer or my laptop  something I worked     hours of overtime for weeks to earn   so it doesn t feel like an apology as much as it feels like a threat of future property destruction    So honestly I m really sad about it  I don t really feel angry about it  I just feel really sad  It logically doesn t contribute much to anything especially in the shape it was in  but I worked on it and I was going to work on it  I tried to get her to understand by saying it d be like if I tore up a page of poetry she wrote  or a short story  or a sewing project  etc   it was something I put my limited amount of time and energy into and it felt good to do it  Now I m not sure how I m going to get the motivation to throw it away  it s completely destroyed   much less try to make it again   To sum it up in a question   is there a trick to feeling better about this sooner  How do I move to the forgiveness part of this  
11,0,My    f  boyfriend s    m  new tattoo makes me feel like a pedophileHey guys  throwaway account because my boyfriend knows my normal account    I don t really know how to begin so I m just gonna dive right in  We ve been together for four years now  living together for   and every aspect of our relationship is honestly perfect and I have a sneaking suspicion that he s planning to propose sometime in the near future    Last year however his younger brother who was only   years old  passed away  This took a major toll on my bf  obviously   but especially because he was extremely close with his little brother  His parents are major screw ups to put it bluntly  and as a result his little brother spent a lot of time living with us  To the point where we practically became like a mum and dad to him and even discussed filing for custody    The problem arises when a few months ago my boyfriend mentioned he wanted to get a tattoo to commemorate his little brother and asked what my thoughts were on this idea  He has no other tattoos and never expressed wanting one before so i was a little surprised but completely supportive  He talked about getting his brother s name or date of birth or something equally sentimental  Cool  I thought  That all sounds beautiful    We didn t really talk about it again until he told me he had booked a time in with a tattoo artist  It was on a day I was working so I couldn t go with him and when I asked what he had decided on he said he wanted it to be a surprise  I was really looking forward to seeing it  thinking it was going to be something small and cute   I did not expect him to come back with an almost life size headshot of his little brother slapped across the majority of his feckin chest   It was definitely a shock but I reacted positively and told him it looked really good  It was only the outlines and such at this point and he said he was going to go back and get it filled in     It s been a few sessions now and he s had the whole shebang done to it  Colours  shading  everything to the point where it could be mistaken for a photo now  I can t deny that it s a seriously incredible piece of artwork  Bf is super proud of it and I honestly think it s pretty cool as well    My only issue with it is during sex    It takes up such a large space on his chest and it s the only tattoo he s got  It doesn t help that he s pretty pale and doesn t have much hair so the tattoo REALLY stands out and my attention is constantly drawn to it    Not to mention this thing is like the Mona fu cken Lisa    Any position that we re facing each other in  I always end up making eye contact with it  And every time I do it makes me feel so uncomfortable and absolutely kills the mood for me  Every time  Ignoring the fact that this kid was practically like a son to us  I doubt I would be able to have sex while looking into the eyes of ANY six year old    It s honestly ruining our sex life    I haven t told my bf any of this because I feel like I can t say anything negative about the tattoo because of its meaning and the fact that it s permanent   I know lasers exist but I doubt he ll ever get rid of it    Lately we ve mainly been having sex in positions where I m facing away from him  or while we keep our shirts on and he s started to notice this and has told me he s worried I m not attracted to him anymore   I am attracted to him  I m just not attracted to the six year old on his chest    What can I do in this situation  The thought of telling him this  or anything negative about the tattoo makes me feel like a monster  But looking at it during sex is making me feel like a monster too    Should I talk to him  Am I overreacting  Is our sex life officially dead    Thanks for any help you guys can give    tl dr  My boyfriend got a massive tattoo of his recently deceased six year old brother on his chest and I can t stop making eye contact with it during sex                          Update  This has gotten a lot more attention than I anticipated  Some people are saying it s reached the front page which is making me consider deleting this post  I m not sure it would be the worst thing if my bf did see this however  Currently debating whether I should just let fate take the wheel on this one    Otherwise I ve received some really phenomenal advice on how I should talk to him and what alternatives we have to make sex less awkward  I was honestly beginning to think this was a relationship ending issue before I made this post but you guys have given me a lot of hope that this is something we can work through  So thank you so much    I ll make a new post to update how things go once I ve talked to my bf about all this  If he doesn t see this post first I think I ll at least show him some of your comments depending on how he reacts  
12,0,My  f    boyfriend  m    used an app to text me through a fake number to see if i would cheat on him    Throw away account  WA USA   We ve been together for   years  a lot has happened  We were on and off    times total  both times he broke up with me  and I ve always been a forgiving person so of course  i take him back every time  The last break up happened when  i was on vacation and when i got back i decided to move on so i got tinder and started talking to a guy for a day or two  and then my ex  boyfriend atm  talked to me about everything and we obviously got back together  He found out about that guy  and the same night we got back together i blocked him EVERYWHERE  except his number because we never texted and i didn t really think we d keep in touch since it was just tinder shit  Anyway  Fast forward to   or   months later to today  Im really really happy  in fact we barely fought and he started showing his more sensitive and romantic side  He s also been really understanding and everything that I d ever wanted  But then one morning i get a green text  iPhone things haha  from an unknown number  i ask a series of questions and it  found out  it was the guy from tinder  we had a short conversation  mainly just me trying to find out who he was  and then  he  said i hurt him so i felt the need to apologize and move on with my life because i don t sit well knowing that i have actually hurt someone  The unknown number kept trying to ask me out and try to hook up and i kept declining because I m not a cheater and would never even do that  so later that night i blocked the number  My mistake was that i never told my boyfriend about it because i just didnt wanna deal with an argument that would definitely start  and that i should have just blocked him from the beginning  but i was curious as to why some guy who i dont even know would be thinking about me   months later after nothing happened    Then this evening my boyfriend and i got into a small fight and then he proceeded to say that I m hiding things from him  Of course i would deny it because i really felt like the whole tinder guy thing was nothing  i never flirted during the conversation or anything  and i stated multiple times that i have a boyfriend  But then i was shocked when my boyfriend told me he was really the person texting me and not the tinder guy  and he said that even though i never flirted back  I m just a shady person because i didnt block him right away  And this broke me  i didnt know how to feel  and i did not know if i was at fault for this  My boyfriend apologized but i still feel so uncomfortable about this  and i feel so confused because he seemed so angry about it when he confronted me  but before confronting me he was all lovey and stuff  I don t know what i feel right now  like was this really wrong  Do i just forgive him  Was i in the wrong  What do i do now  
13,0,My     girlfriend     and I have been dating for   months  She wants to have dinner with a guy she used to hook up withWe started off just casual and open but got serious about a month into meeting  Things have been great and we re getting feelings fast    She coaches MMA and  used to hook up with a fellow coach a month before we met  She called it quits when she found out he had a girlfriend    She just told me that they are having dinner next week but that I have nothing to worry about and that it was just physical   What bothers me is that she still wants to have dinner with this guy who was keeping secrets from her  if it were me I know I wouldn t want to see this person again  Which makes me think that she may actually have feelings for him or did   What should I say 
14,0,I was best friends with a narcissist  She ruined my marriage and just when I thought I was free of her  she turned up in another aspect my life Seven years ago I was a happily married woman with   kids under the age of    I was a stay at home mom and my husband worked in corporate IT  I had become best friends with a woman across the street  let s call her Jackie   Her daughter and my eldest  also a girl  had become best friends as toddlers  Her husband and my husband were friends  The two families did everything together  We hung out on  weekends and went on vacations  I kept Jackie s daughter after school  Jackie and her husband also worked in the corporate world but for a semi conductor company  Jackie was the bread winner    Everything was grand  Well in hindsight I now see she was constantly manipulating and controlling me  I had lost my identity in the years after becoming a mom  Staying at home with kids can be very isolating and I craved any adult interaction I could get  Her friendship was so convenient    Anyways  in the summer      my husband and Jackie started meeting for lunches and happy hours  They said that it started out innocent  They said they needed to blow off steam and commiserate about working in the corporate world and being the bread winners  It was such a burden for them  Meanwhile I m at home with all three of the kids losing my freaking mind  Their meetings eventually turned romantic  By the fall my marriage was falling apart but I chalked his strange demeanor up to his stress at work  He told me there was a huge project due  But he was actually falling in love with Jackie and was wrestling with the guilt and frustration of having an affair  Jackie was still acting like she was my BFF  We still hung out alone and I confided in her as you do with a girl friend  She took anything I said then and in the past and shared it with my husband  She twisted my words and thoughts and manipulated him into thinking I was undeserving of him and a horrible wife    Just after the new year things came to a head  They both asked for divorces but did not confess to their relationship  I didn t think this was suspicious  I knew she was unhappy with her marriage  I was shocked by my husbands request though  I fought like hell to try save the marriage  We went to counseling  I poured every moment into trying to figure it out  My world was crashing  And Jackie was still playing the part of bff  She would come over and borrow nail polish or take me out for a girls night   all while secretly dating my husband  And my husband and I still had a regular sex life  I did not suspect he was cheating at all  In mid February  they finally confessed  I kicked him out and we began divorce proceedings    By July  the divorce was final  I sold the house and moved to the other side of the city to start my life over again  I cut ties with mutual friends   In January of      stumbled into my new career  craft beer   I  nor my husband or Jackie  had not been into craft beer previously  We all drank beer  but this was a new world  I eventually landed a full time job with a brewery by the fall of        By then I had also met a man that I am marrying this summer  but that s another story     As I started getting into craft beer I quickly started running into my ex and Jackie  They had taken an interest in craft beer as well  This is where I feel like I m being stalked  Like she can t have an original idea  She wants to take anything good in my life and make it hers  She still works in the corporate world but she  blogs  about beer  She shows up to every beer event and she became heavily involved in every beer group for women she could find    That s all fine  but where I draw the line is one particular group that I want to be more active in  It s an organization for women who work in the beer industry  There are   different ways you can qualify to be a member  One is to work in the beer industry and make at least     of your income from beer  Two is to own a brewery or bar  Three is to be enrolled in an accredited school to learn train for something in the beer industry  Jackie makes six figures at her corporate job  She blogs for free or for minimal compensation  There s no way it would come close to     of her income  And yet  her blogging is what she claims makes her eligible    I ve tried going to the local and national group leaders  No on understands her ability to lie and manipulate  It just makes me look like a bitter jealous ex out for petty revenge  The truth is that I love my industry  I love this organization  I want to participate because it s good for my career  It s just a hobby for her  She feels special being in this exclusive group  But she doesn t belong  I don t know what to do    I should point out that since the divorce  I have taken the high road  I have not sought revenge  I ve cooperated with all custody  I never talk bad about my ex or his new wife  they got married   years ago  to my children  Jackie is driving me crazy  My hate and anger towards her is affecting my mental health  I don t know what to do about this situation  When we have to be at events together  we just ignore one another  That can be awkward when there s only a handful of women present   It s all just so unfair  I m also conflicted because if she hadn t destroyed my marriage  I would not have been forced to find my true self again  I would not have met my fianc   and I would not have a career that I am so passionate about    So  do I just go on ignoring her and be my badass self  Or do I try to get her removed from the group knowing there may be repercussions  Or do I find some clever way to  fuck  with her as payback for being such a shitty human being

19,0,I    m  found out my dad raped my mom a long time agoMy parents had a fight last week and they were just yelling at each other in front of me and my mom randomly brought up that he raped her like way before  early on in their marriage I m guessing  She was obviously very upset about it and his face just went white and he acted like he didn t know what she was talking about  it was      clear that he did do it and was just acting dumb on purpose and got mad that she brought it up  I don t know if that was the first time she confronted him about it  I have no idea  I just went to my room and I didn t wanna hear them anymore   Now  they are back to normal and completely lovey dovey as if none of that ever happened  I don t know what am I m supposed to do  I can t even look my fucking father in the face  I hate his guts and I can t believe he hurt my mom like that  When I see them kiss or even sitting next to each other  I just wanna kick his ass and tell him to get away from her    my mom talked to me about it and told me that they were good now and I have to get over it but I can t do that  How could he rape my mom  I know it sounds so fucked up but I can t help but imagine it  it breaks my heart that she had to go through that and it makes me cry and I wish he could die  So I told her that she shouldn t put up with that and that he s a piece of shit and she just said that people make mistakes and she loves him and he s a good man   what am I supposed to do

21,0,I    f  found out a while ago that my dad    m  was flirting with my half sister    f  and I will never get over it  and other shit about my parents Edit  It doesn t take long to look at my post history and find out that I am  indeed       My ages may not be exactly right besides mine  I do not know the exact age of my dad or sister  I know I should know them by now but it s not important   My mom used to be married to another man and had   kids  then her husband starting working a lot and not helping out at all  among other things  so she divorced and later married my dad   They had me and my sister  and when I was around    or     we adopted my little brother  I know  a lot of kids    So anyway  one night I was down at my sister s house and it was getting late  so I sat down on her couch next to her and was looking through her phone for my dad s number to ask if he could come pick me up  I couldn t find it  so I just dicked around for a bit on her contacts to find if she just hadn t put in his name or something   I found a number that had no name at the very bottom of her text conversations  so I looked through the texts to see if I could see my dad s name  I know  it s an invasion of privacy  but my sister was sitting next to me the whole time and I told her I was gonna look and see if I could find dad in her conversations    I saw the number flirting at her and she was doing the standard  ohh yeah    haha that s cool   bull crap  But then my heart sank  I saw my dad s name in one of the messages and I lost my breath  I got up with her phone and walked into another room  I read through the whole chat and I was so confused   The very last text she sent said  delete  at the bottom  so I was scared she deleted an inappropriate picture he sent to her  or maybe she was sending them to him  I don t know my mind was racing   I paced around the room  silently balling my eyes out  trying to get my voice to quit shaking long enough for me to call her name to tell her what I found after debating just forgetting it ever happened   Finally I called her name   Rachel    Yeah    Can you come here for a second    She came in and saw me sitting on the bed crying  She sat down next to me and grabbed my arms and asked me what was wrong  It must have been   minutes of me crying before I finally worked up the nerve to tell her  I did an awful job of explaining  and she didn t understand  but finally I gave her the phone and just showed her   The first thing she said was  I thought mom already told you   And I was so confused  She told me she would tell me about it in the morning so I could sit down with her and mom  but I demanded we go wake her up   So we drove back to my house and we woke my mom up  telling her it was important  We all sat in my little brother s room and talked for a few minutes about it   Essentially  my dad started drunkingly  flirting with my own sister  and even made a Instagram page where he would take pictures of her shooting guns  they would go shoot in the woods together  and post them  My mom found out and debated leaving him  but decided to give him another chance  Apparently it s all better because he goes to church now and is saved   I love my mother and father so much  but I will never see him the same way again  My mom told me to never bring it up to him and pretend I forgot  which I did  but I never really forgot  He still drinks a lot and is basically killing himself with all of the crap that s going in his body to help him sleep and wake up  Me and my mom even speculate he has a girlfriend  which I m almost positive he does  She cries to me and tells me she wishes he would just leave her already and give her peace  since he s so mean to her  She even says he hates her   I want my parents to divorce  is that bad  I feel awful about it  but it s the truth  They re hurting my baby brother and me and my sister  I daydream about telling my friends and getting support from them  but I m deathly afraid that they ll make it awkward or kick me out of the friend group   It s all so fucked up  the truth is my parents are fucked up  My mom wouldn t even consider divorce because she says it s up to God  not her  I can t talk to my dad because our relationship isn t that good anyway  and my mom is a brick wall   I don t know what to do  I honestly am just thinking about suicide  I can never forget about this  it s on my mind       I just want support and advice  Thank you 
22,0,My    M  girlfriend    F  of    years dumped me on Valentines day for my bestfriend    M  of     years and I m devastated A bit of background  I met my girlfriend at a mutual friends birthday party when we were both    and a few months later we ended up dating  I struggled with University due to my father getting cancer  working to cover the lost income my father provided  and a video game addiction    Because of this I ve been in University for a really long time but I m doing a lot better with my father recovering which allowed me to quit working to focus on school and I quit playing video games since it was causing me so much trouble  Then my girlfriend broke up with me rather suddenly on Valentines day and   weeks later moved in with my bestfriend on March    They have both told me that they have romantic feelings for one another   My bestfriend  who s NEVER had a girlfriend  was an honors student his whole life and graduated about     years ago with a masters in Accounting  He now works in an accounting office making good money  My girlfriend on the other hand is  x college drop out and works   minimum wage jobs and spends nearly all of her income on herself  I mention this because I feel like the discrepancy between them in education and earning spending habits will lead to an unhappy relationship for the both of them   She has also not mentioned anything about the breakup with her family or friends and they re all really confused  I briefly  talked to her mother about it but I didn t want to mention too many things to respect my ex s privacy and simply told her that if she wanted to know more that she should ask her daughter   When the breakup happened  I was heartbroken  She simply told me that she lost the spark for me but found it in my bestfriend  I struggled to sleep eat work for days whilst she was happily packing her things to move in with my bestfriend  I slowly get my shit together and started working harder in school and have committed fully to working out in the gym  Now that they moved in together  she tells me that she misses seeing talking to me everyday but is still happy living with bestfriend  She asks me if we could hang out  just us    to catch up a little  I agree and she comes over to my house  parents are gone on vacation so I m alone at home   At this point its been more than a month since the breakup and I ve been doing a lot better    When she arrived  she hugged me for a long time  I didn t say anything because I felt like she needed the hug  She soon starts crying and says she misses me so much that whenever she is completely alone she has the urge to cry  or if she s at work she has a lump in her throat and is constantly thinking about me  She also tells me  I wish you did something really bad so that it would be easier to get over you   I calm her down and sit her down on the couch so that we could talk  After a few minutes of talking she starts to take notice of my improved physical state  I m a        lbs male with naturally broad shoulders which I know she loves     She then starts feeling me up and shortly after she s on my lap grinding on me  I politely tell her to stop and help her off me to which she gets even more upset  I calm her down and she leaves to go have dinner at her bestfriend s place  The next morning she texts me complimenting on me getting in better shape and soon says  I wish we had sex yesterday  and  would you want to have sex with me too   to which I tell her no  She starts crying again but doesn t mention having sex with me anymore  The whole interaction left me confused and a little disgusted   My bestfriend has no idea about the interaction and I m not sure if I should tell him because I don t want him to think I m making this up to try to get back together with her  or to get back at him  even though I have proof from the text messages  I m also really mad at him because I felt like he went behind my back to seduce my girlfriend and ever since the breakup he has made   effort in trying to contact me to see how I m doing regarding the breakup  I ve even brought it up with him to which he responded  I was thinking about what to say but I haven t figured out what to say exactly   Bullshit detected    I still want to be friends with them but I can t stand seeing them eyeing one another  I mostly just want Her to be happy  even if it means leaving me for it  At the same time I don t want to get back together with her because I feel like she s betrayed me and I have already convinced myself that I m worthy of someone better than her     TL DR Girlfriend leaves me for my bestfriend and moves in with him weeks later  A month after the breakup she tries to have sex with me and I turn her down leaving me very confused and Her very depressed  I still want to be friends with them both but have very conflicted feelings 
23,0,My first Tinder disappointmentAbout a month ago I downloaded Tinder after being new to the dating scene again  recently divorced  I was thoroughly unimpressed with the profiles I was seeing on there  Picky  Maybe  but I have a different approach to dating now  being a bit older and knowing what I want       I stumbled across a guy named Ben  lives near me  around the same age  We seemed to have a lot in common  I swiped right  and was pleasantly surprised to see that he was a  match      amp  x   B   We started talking on Tinder for a few days  and moved our conversation over to texting  I had just come down with the flu and was unable to meet for a couple of weeks while I was on the mend  He was pretty consistent with wanting to talk to me frequently  always giving me a good morning text  goodnight texts  decently consistent communication throughout the day  We d send selfies back and forth  I was excited to meet him  He does work a very strange and sporadic schedule  so I figured there would be times where I would not get to talk with him as much  I have a fairly busy life myself and I am not one who generally requires constant attention  He explained to me that he was looking for more of a long term thing with someone  and not just a  tinder hookup       We met about   weeks ago  I was instantly attracted to him in person  He warned me he had  no game  and was a little awkward in person  I didn t think so  I thought we clicked right off the bat and had a great time with no awkwardness  After a couple hours  he kissed me  Man  it was such a great kiss  It didn t seem to me that this was just a physical thing  we laughed  chatted  etc  We did end up having sex the first night we might  Which I saw no problem with in the moment  but now I am thinking maybe I should have made a different choice   I didn t hear from him the next day  which was surprising since we had talked so much before meeting  and had what I thought was a good date  I figured he was probably working  And pretty late in the day he did apologize for not reaching out because he had gotten called into work  No worries  The next day  same situation  heard from him once late in the day  due to work  At least he was communicating that with me  no problem    amp  x   B   As the days went by after the weekend I started hearing from him less frequently  And it seemed the times I did text with him  it was only because he wanted to having some sexual conversation  I m not opposed to sexual conversation  as I am a highly sexual person  But  I need more than that   or I need you to tell me that is all that you are looking for    amp  x   B   Fast forward now to three weeks after our date  He was in Vegas for vacation last week with some of his buddies for March Madness  During our date he told me he had really been craving peanut butter cookies  and I personally love to bake  So I thought to myself  why not make him a couple dozen cookies and drop them off on his doorstep so he has a little treat to come back to after Vegas  So  I did just that  Dropped them off Monday morning when he was to be getting home Monday afternoon  Maybe it was too soon for me to do something like that  I m a giver  I love taking care of people  spoiling them  etc  I really enjoyed his company  and saw no problem with my seemingly simple gesture     amp  x   B   Well  it is now Thursday night and I haven t heard from him since Sunday afternoon  I am surprised that I am as disappointed as I am  I was just surprised with how well we clicked and how this just all fell off the face of the earth  I am taking it pretty hard  Maybe I am just too sensitive  I don t feel like I want to reach out because if he had interest in talking to me  he would  He did for weeks consistently before we met  so why not now    amp  x   B   Just bummed about this  Maybe he didn t like me in person  Why can t he just tell me that  if that is the case    amp  x   B   Bless your heart if you read this entire thing  I guess I just needed the vent  
24,0,Ex girlfriend wants me to waitMy girlfriend and myself broke up just over a month ago  alcohol was involved as we were celebrating buying a house together  Both of us have issues with drinking  I m over the top and she gets extremely flirty  That night we got into a heated fight and she said she was moving out and of course that hit me right in the heart  She came back the next day to drop something off and I assumed she would be picking some of her things up  now please bear with me here as I already hate myself for this part and am in no way justifying my actions  She was upset and I could tell she d been crying so I tried to hug her and she pushed that away  then she stood in the doorway the whole time and one thing led to another  I told her to just go  she told me she stayed at a guys place just to hurt me  so I shoved her back  When I say shoved I truly mean shoved  she moved back about a foot then she left    An hour later the police showed up and arrested me for assault because a neighbor saw the situation through a peep hole  After a few hours in a cell waiting I was questioned and sent home with a no contact order  Believe it or not I was trying to follow that rule because I have a daughter  who of course was not with me that weekend hence the chance to go out  and if I contacted her I believed I would go to jail  For one day I heard nothing but after that first day I had many messages from her asking begging me to talk to her because she knew we could fix us  I love her and it hurt me to see how much pain she was in so I fell for it  I talked to her    She called me at     in the morning saying I had to come get her because she wanted to kill herself and that no one but me would ever want her so I went and got her  Then I discovered that out of spite she found one of my oldest friends on Facebook that she had never met before and started a relationship with him to hurt me  When I confronted her about it she said that if I bug her anymore she ll tell the cops we d been talking  Later she apologized for that and told me she only planned on doing things with him because she was mad so I believed her again  We planned a little day trip for that weekend and she said she had plans with her friends Friday but she could leave Saturday with me  Friday before she went out she came to me kissed me  told me she loved me  and said she was happy we were fixing us    Skip ahead to Saturday night  we had an amazing day full of talking and figuring things out and she told me she wanted to come home so I was beyond happy  We went to bed and I saw her phone go off and it was a message from him  I truly tried not to look but I couldn t help it after a flood of messages from him that late at night after she said she was done with him days ago  I looked  I wish I hadn t because I saw the pictures she took of them together the message about what hotel he was at and when to come  that s who she was with Friday night  Again when I asked her she called me crazy and was threating to tell the police again that I contacted her  I was destroyed  it killed me to see that the person I love most and one of my oldest friends could do that too me  as if I was nothing to them both  Pathetically enough I forgave her  again   She has continually asked me to wait and not to give up and at the same time had been unimaginably cruel to me  I know it stupid of me for waiting but I can t stop  I have tried and she always comes back and says something amazing  The moment I see or hear from her it s like I m back at square one and I broke down this week because she told me that she s moving to the city my  friend  is from  When I heard that I gave up and said  ok have a good life  to which she got upset because I should assume we ll never be together again    I just don t understand why I m stuck after everything she s done  I know I deserved to be hurt after what I did but I honestly can t handle any of it now  But here I am  waiting  with full understanding that she is only doing this to hurt me and doesn t want me back I wait still  Is it blind loyalty or just a fear of being alone   Everyone seems to hate me now because she tells the story very vaguely so when I try they don t believe me  none of them know I ve been saving the messages and recording the interactions every time  I won t show anyone because i dont want people thinking less of her   Edit   there is so much to the story and this is just the quick way to tell it    Edit     trust me when I know I fucked up  I risked losing everything to answer her and that was a mistake  Now I just don t want her to snap and make me lose my daughter

26,0,My    m  Employee    f   Likes  Me I m known as the office asshole  I don t have  work friends   I don t engage in conversation outside of common courtesies and professional communication  I m curt  I m abrasive  I m occasionally insulting  etc  In short  I m a dick no one wants to work with or under but they can t afford to lose me so I m here      months ago I hired a girl into my department  She was inexperienced  lacked confidence and knowledge  but she was sharp and she was trainable    months ago she surpassed my other employees and I started putting more time into her   I haven t been kind to her  I ve made her cry dozens of times and try to quit twice  but refused her letters of resignation  She gets the hardest projects  she gets the most work  I m not patient with her  her errors are harshly reprimanded  I expect more of her  If she took me to HR I d be fired   She s  good    but as a female in this industry she s got a tough time ahead of her  She needs confidence in her own abilities  she needs to learn to stand up for herself and she needs thick skin  If she manages that she ll have my job within the year and a pretty damned good start to a career with it      To clarify one point  I m not an anti social asshole  I have friends I see regularly  I m close with my family  etc  I just like keeping work as work   Yesterday my employee and I were wrapping up a particularly frustrating project and she asked me if I wanted to go get drinks to celebrate  Usually that d be an instant no  but I really needed a drink   We went out  we drank  it was fun  At one point    Her  I never thought you d date your employee    Me  Is this a date    Her  It is if I come home with you    Me  You re not coming home with me    Her  It s a date anyway  Next time    Me  I see       I thought she was joking at the time  We hung out for a while longer and I drove her home  She kissed me on the cheek when she got out of my vehicle  Apparently she wasn t joking  she asked me an hour ago if I wanted to see a movie with her and then go to her place for dinner   So  She s cool  I do like her as a person  she s fun and she s smart  My questions are      Why would she like me  I ve been nothing but cold to her     I m half her age over again  what does she want with me   I don t care about the employee thing  if I decide I want to do this I ll quit     Truth is my dating history is    unfortunate  and I wasn t intending to get back to it anytime soon  Given that this job means nothing to me  is this worth pursuing at all or is it already a recipe for failure 
27,0,Is it normal to keep a  tally  of your SO s actions that you don t like My question comes from my SO last night who came home very drunk   after a night out with friends  She stumbled into our bedroom and blurted out   I ve got a tally going of all the things I don t like about you   like why you didn t come out with my friends tonight   And then proceeded to faceplant and pass out  She claims to not remember any of this    Reason I didn t go out last night was because I had a really important presentation I had to do today so I wanted to go to bed early   she was fully aware of that    EDIT  well I talked to her today and she didn t have a literal checklist but she had a mental one and it was kinda rough to be honest   probably parting ways soon but it s just up in the air right now 
28,0,I    F  re downloaded Tinder to surprise my boyfriend    M  for our anniversary and now he suspects I m unfaithful My boyfriend  Daniel  and I met on Tinder last year  When we made things official  I deleted the Tinder app  it didn t dawn on me to delete the actual account itself   And up until now  everything was going great  We were even taking about the future for us in the next couple of years   Here s where things went wrong  It s coming up to our one year anniversary and I am planning something creative for him  I wanted to make a collection of the memories we made throughout the year  pics  videos  songs  souvenirs etc  and put them together in a hilarious presentation  then make him his favourite dinner and give him a new pair of shoes I know he s had his eye on for a few weeks now  I had the idea to include screenshots of our first conversation on Tinder and that s when I remembered that my account was still there meaning our conversation was still probably there  I re downloaded it and quickly saw that his account had been deleted and so the conversation was not there anymore  I then promptly deleted my account  ignoring the messages I received over the year   In that moment  Daniel comes back from rugby with his friends and we talked  had dinner and spent a nice evening together  Later he s using my phone to transfer pics to his laptop and he asks me why I have the Tinder app on my phone   I thought we deleted ours long ago when we first started dating    That s when I realised that I forgot to delete the app itself  Though I didn t wanna ruin the surprise I was making for him but I had no excuse so I just told him the truth and assured him that there was no other reason   I just forgot to delete the app itself   He didn t believe me  He kept asking me if I was telling the truth and even asked me to sign in to see if I had been talking to someone  I told him that the account was deleted and that I hadn t spoken to anyone and I m not speaking to any other guy on or off Tinder   You have to believe me  I just wanted to surprise you   I even then showed him the presentation and ended up explaining the whole surprise to him  He became less accusatory but his attitude was bad the whole night  He didn t even want to be intimate with me   I m really tired  maybe tomorrow morning   The next morning he left early for the gym  We met up for lunch  where proceeded to ask me again if I was       being honest and not talking to anyone else  and I assured him that I was being honest  But he was distant and acting moody the whole day and now for the past couple of days he s cancelled a date and hasn t been as communicative with me   I m worried that he doesn t trust me anymore and deep down I don t think he believes me  I think he thinks I was talking to other guys  even though I showed him everything of proof that I wasn t  Our anniversary is in a few weeks and I don t know what to do  Do I sit him down  Do I give him space  Do I suddenly suspect him   my mother says cheaters usually try to make their partners look bad over small things and that it could be what he is doing  Though I don t suspect he is  He hasn t shown any signs and he always lets me use his phone  We ve never had these problems before and everything seemed to be going so well between us before this  What do I do Reddit    
29,0,My    m  long distance boyfriend cheated on me   f  and he wants me to forgive him because he says he still loves me Sorry for the long read  Tl DR at the end    I m going to start this off by saying we met online when I was maybe    or so and we became fast friends and played together a couple of times a week  I was a really lonely kid  I had no friends until middle school so meeting someone like him was such a comfort  He always asked about me  he cheered me up when I was down and fast forward a few years and he s my best friend and boyfriend    We ve met up twice in real life  both times were magical for me  I planned a bunch of romantic dates and we spend a lot of time cuddled up in bed  I loved him with every piece of my heart  He was the one that knew me better then anyone and I trusted him absolutely and I never thought he could cheat  my mistake I guess    The last  nd  time he came to visit me was after he had cheated  I didn t know the whole week he was here and he didn t tell me until way after he left  I invited some friends that were excited to meet him over for dinner and made lasagne  He just seemed a little distant and aloof but I genuinely just thought my friends might be a little too much and he was just shy  One of them told me they didn t want to hurt my feelings but he just give her a  weird vibe   her words not mine  I even got defensive when she told me and told her he was just quiet    He told me what he did over Skype  I was clearly devastated  but to his credit he was remorseful  told me how guilty he felt and how he couldn t sleep at night and that he ruined the best thing he ever had  Seeing him cry was so strange  previously I would have moved mountains and oceans for him that was how much I loved him and now I just felt empty  Like I had nothing left in me  no love  no joy just an empty pit wanting to swallow me alive    I know I m not alone and everyone deals with stuff like this but I just feel so betrayed  I had      trust and faith in him and he betrayed me anyways  I ve been keeping distance while he s adamant that he s going to try to fix this and that he still loves me  My heart wants to believe him so badly but my brain can t let me get hurt like that again  Ive never felt so lonely in my life  Is it even possible to trust him after what s happened  Can I forgive him  Should I    TL DR long distance boyfriend cheated twice  claims to still love me and wants a relationship  
30,0,Boyfriend    M  not sure about our future together after I    F  asked for a threesomeWe ve been together for approximately   years and things have slowed down a little in the bedroom  He said that he is tired due to his medical degree being very demanding  Anyway  in the past when I asked if he could see us marrying  he said yes but not before we are more settled in life  Two weeks ago  I was thinking that we could spice things up in the bedroom and asked him if we could consider bringing in another woman for a threesome for some fun  I thought he d be excited and would jump at the opportunity to get to sleep with another woman like most men  Unfortunately  it didn t go down well   He said no and later when I asked him why he was being distant  he said that he was a bit disgusted that I suggested a threesome  He said that he would never want to bring in another person into the relationship  and that my bringing it up made him wonder if we were right for each other in the long term because sexual compatibility in every sense is important   I asked him yesterday where we were heading and he said he didn t know   Should I give him more time  Or have I ruined my relationship   TLDR  My boyfriend doesn t know if we have a future together after I asked for a threesome  How do I handle this

32,0,My    M  Aunt    F  keeps sending me texts of unborn dead fetusesHey everyone  kind of a weird thing to be asking about I know  I don t really know how to start this so apologies in advance   So this past  th of July my dad s side of the family all went to my grandpa s farm to celebrate  We all had a great time and eventually left to go home  We were housing my aunt s family for the night as their plane left the next morning  We were all talking in the living room and my aunt brought up the heartbeat abortion bill that was brought up in Iowa  where I live   She loved it and thought more states should adopt it  or something very similar  For those of you who don t know  basically the bill said that once a fetus has a heartbeat  it is illegal to have an abortion  thankfully it was deemed unconstitutional   She is a very religious woman  which is what she bases her beliefs off of  I am not religious anymore  Anyway  she saw my facial reaction to that and said   Oh you think killing babies is good  That murder is perfectly fine    Now we don t have time to unpack all of that unpleasant conversation  but basically I said I was pro choice since if I got a girl pregnant  I would never want to dictate what she did pressure her  I mean she s the one that has to carry it for     months  go through labor  etc etc  Anyway I digress   So since then it was about once a week she would send me photos articles about why abortion is murder morally wrong  I would reply  stop  or something very similar  By Oct I had got fed up and said  stop or I m blocking your number   She didn t so I blocked her  I didn t receive anything until late January   Since then I ve been getting photos articles from random numbers with the same area code once every day or two  I block each one after I receive a text   Now  I wasn t sure it was her until she flew back in for St  Patrick s Day and asked me if I had changed my mind about murdering babies  I said I hadn t and told her to stop yet again  Turns out she had downloaded one of those free texting apps where you put in your zip code and it gives you a number and only works on wifi   So what do I do  I ve asked her to stop numerous times without success  She seems hell bent on continuing until I concede which I won t because I believe in pro choice  I ve thought about getting a no contact order  but don t know how well that would work  I ve also thought about getting a restraining order  but think it might be a bit much  any advice would be greatly appreciated  I m just lost about what to do   Edit     Thank you all so much for your feedback support  I knew she was crazy  but after reading all of your replies I realized how truly crazy she is  I saw many of you want an update and I will be posting one in a few days  I unblocked my aunt s actual number telling her that I have reported her to the police for harassment and if she continues I will have to continue working with them  She said I was a baby murderer who was full of crap  so I m going to wait a few days to see if she actually continues sending me stuff or not   I am currently researching organizations I can donate to in her name  If I decide on one in the next few days I plan on posting a link with my donation on my update as long as its not against the rules  If anyone else would like to donate too that would be amazing  Thank you all so much for the help  I truly appreciate it  
33,0,My girlfriend went skinny dipping with her ex during her tripWe are both    still in college  Spring break came around during which I always go to spend some time with my family since I don t see them much  She on the other hand planned a trip with some friends to go to the beach  Apparently her friends had invited a bunch of people and his ex got thrown in the mix  As soon as my girlfriend found out they were staying in the same place she asked me if it was okay  Of course I was a little uncomfortable but I m the type of person that believes that jealousy in a relationship can be toxic and besides  her telling me everything as soon as she found out made feel better about the whole situation so I told her it was okay  Since we are both really close we agreed to send each other lots of pictures and communicate as much as possible  this was going to be difficult since I was going to be in a different time zone     Fast forward to the trip  I m with my family and as agreed I would let her know everything  send pictures and ask questions about her trip  She  however  never sent me any picture of her aside from a couple of group pictures their friends took and would only reply  with short answers  My thoughts were that she was at the beach so of course she was not going to have her phone with her most of the time so I decided not to say much about it    The week goes by and we both meet up and talk about our trips  After a while of talking she tells me that the place where they were staying had a little private beach and she finally got the chance to go skinny dipping which she had wanted to do for a while  Although I was a little disappointed because we had been talking about doing it together since neither of us had ever done it I was happy for her because she had gotten a good opportunity  I asked her who she did it with she reluctantly told me that with everyone including her ex  This made me really uncomfortable but I honestly didn t know how to react  after all she had told me the truth  I told her that I was a little disappointed since we had agreed to do it together to which she told me that I probably would have never done it anyway  We had a little discussion about it and she ended up saying she was sorry although that didn t make anything better    Where I really screwed up was by getting paranoid and going through her phone  I noticed she had been texting him  before she didn t have his number  so curiosity got the best of me and I went through some of the texts and    While there was nothing very incriminating I did find that they were discussing going to am event out of town in a couple of months  This falls on a date where she knows I will also be out of town   Am I overreacting  She now knows how upset I am about the skinny dipping and she has apologized many times and says she would take it back if she could  Going as far as to going through her texts made me feel like a possessive piece of shit and I just don t know how to deal with the situation  
34,0,Struggling to be okay after a breakupSorry for the long post and if the format is strange  I m writing this on my phone    I ve recently gone through a  breakup   it s sucked and was painful as it was caused by external situations  saying this  there could of been ways around it but that wasn t the route that they chose   It s tough because I feel like I m the only one who is upset by this  I always feel like there s sad emotions looming and it s hard  Ive spoken to friends  I ve been travelling and reading more  Trying to occupy my time  as well journaling to write down my feelings and really understand them  We weren t together long  but it was an intense few months  They weren t perfect and I know that  and everyone says you ll find someone better but right now I feel like I don t want somebody else but this person   even if they aren t the best    I catch myself obsessively checking social media  I m trying to spend less time on it as I know this just sends me in a spiral but it s the only way I feel somewhat weirdly  connected  to them    I don t know how to snap out of this and how to get better  I m tired of feeling like this and I don t know how to fix it  I also find myself thinking about worst possible scenarios   they come back and they re in a committed relationship and everything that could of been  can t   Again  I know this is very black and white thinking and the world doesn t work like that  But I also don t want to live on false hope   I feel constantly conflicted  I know things will eventually be okay but right now I don t know what to do  I don t want to feel these low and negative emotions   Sorry for the long post and appreciate all advice 
35,0,Should I be worriedMy husband and I recently just got back together after breaking up for a few months   I know that he was having contact with someone else and he said they just talked on the phone and texted   So I noticed he has been hiding his phone from me and confronted him about it  He didn t say anything at all  So at this point I am just worried that he is back with me until this other person wants to start dating him 
36,0,Am I right to be upset at him My boyfriend      and I      have been together for   years now  We have our ups and downs just like every relationship  but most of our arguments tend to branch from how he s a jump into everything head first kind of person  He always does things last minute and always expects me to go a long  One example is when we used to live in Texas  His dad called an old company he used to work for in Wisconsin because they were looking for something that would make them more money  The company offered them a job at a rate that was almost twice of what they were currently making  My boyfriend was excited and without consulting me he packed up everything and quit his job and was prepared to take off to Wisconsin the same day  I come home from work and hes in the car ready to go  He had no idea where he was going to stay and he barely had any funds to survive a week  It was just chaotic I was very upset  It took them a week to get hired after they had made the trip and I had to constantly send money grams for their hotel  I continued to do that for another   months because that s how long it took him to find an apartment  Mind you I was the only one calling about apartments and setting up showings for him  All  The  Way  From  Texas    It was a very frustrating time in our relationship  Maybe I m dumb for going a long with it    That s just a small example  He s done so much crazy shit that makes no sense and we ve moved so many times  He gets angry when I wont quit my job to do any of the crazy stuff he has planned or whatever    This is so cliche and super dumb  but yeah I love him  He just causes me so much stress I feel so overwhelmed and I feel like I cant do it anymore  Am I right to be upset when he does things like this  He just says I m over reacting  I dont know anymore  I ve tried leaving but he was asks  Well what about me   And says that if I leave he ll have no one  It just makes me feel super bad cause hes not a bad guy  I ve tried explaining the stress he causes me and how I feel but nothing s really changed    Sorry about the grammar and the English 
37,0,My girlfriend    f  told me she maybe wants to take a break it s not her it s me  Our relationship was going so well  we hung out all this week then she said that too me  In the morning she said how she wanted to be with me forever but then she says that I m just sooo confused  As of right now we are not taking a break but now idk if she loves me or how she feels  Has this happen to anyone before  
38,0,I know my    F  partner    M  has been masturbating to pictures of one of my best friends It hurts  deeply  She s lovely and a goddess and honestly I can t blame him  but I desperately wish he didn t fantasize about a friend I we see on a regular basis  I m the asshole who snooped and found out and I m certainly paying for it  I can t shake the feeling that this is normal behavior  but it still doesn t sit right with me  Do I need to get over myself and accept this  or do I stand my ground in believing it to be morally wrong 
39,0,I almost got kidnapped yesterday  They pretended to be my brother  I went there but the car vanished  Today  we checked the schools cameras footage and we saw the car  We told the police  I am scared   Yesterday     while I was hanging out after school with my friends  we were still near school  a place we always hang out   a girl  classmate  came to me and said   your brother told me to tell you that he is waiting behind the school for you    I swear I was about to get up when I realized that my brother can easily call me on the phone  I called my brother  he wasn t answering  he was at work   we asked the girl how the guy she saw looks like  She told me and everything she said was how my brother typically looks like  She also said that he was in his car  She said that she was leaving school and he called her  At that time I thought  maybe its him   My friends told me to go with all of us  we were    that girl  it was weird situation  maybe it was my brother  it was just weird situation  I decided to go with them to see who that person was but there was no car anymore  I kept on calling my brother  Finally  my brother answered and he said that he never came to my school today   The girl was so sure that there was a guy searching for me because he gave her my name  class and he even mentioned the colour of my hair  The most suspicious is that the girl was my classmate too  I mean how did he pick my classmate   how did he know she knows me and knows where I hang out  Also I am even suspicious of the girl  I mean why help him  but maybe because I am her classmate she helped him  I am confused   I called my father to pick me up     Today     There was truly someone that pretended to be my brother  Me and my father went to the principle today and we even checked the school camera footage  There was a car  we couldnt see his face and the plate number but everything my classmate said was true  there was really someone that lied about being my brother  We went to the police  we told them everything  my classmate told them how the guy looked like  The police said they will make sure to drive by our house and school everyday  guarding    I am scared  i started to sleep with my brother LOL but i dont want to sleep alone     Any advice  do you think something can happen 
40,0,I    m  feel like I don t deserve my girlfriend    f She treats me so well and has so much going for  she has her life together and is the first person I ve met like this that s been willing to stick around and stay with me  I just feel so undeserving and guilty about it  I m an alcoholic and a drug addict that s trying to stop  She tries to get me to stop and everytime I relapse she keeps saying its not my fault and its a disease and hugs me  She says she loves me but I feel like I m holding her back and it makes me feel like a child and not a boyfriend  I m thinking of breaking up with her just because I know she can do so much better than me  Do you guys think I should 
41,0,I      don t see a real future with my GF      We ve been together for a little over a year and have lived together for about half of that time  The longer we are together  the more I am not seeing a future with her  such as marriage or kids  Our careers paths are very different and those could possibly take us far apart by distance  Also we have different views on aspects of life such as home living  ethics  and various other beliefs  and I can see those as creating distance between us    I am a very non confrontational person so I just listen and don t really argue about things  When I do feel like saying something  she tends to snap back and try to discredit and challenge what I say  and most times she is pretty harsh about it  so I am always nervous to say things  This also applies to when she asks me if we are ok or if we are still good together  Im nervous to say how Im feeling due to things getting upsetting and personally  so I just say everything is fine  With everything else going on with me  I don t want to go through that at this time  so I am worried about that    Recently  I have been thinking about what it would be like if we did break up and if it would be hard to do and get through  To me  I get more of a freeing feeling  but it would be hard since we have been together for so long  and it would be very hard for her  so I am worried  I do care about her and don t want to hurt her in any way    Any advice would be great for me on how to move forward in this  Im stuck and need some help    Thank you so much  
42,0,My girlfriend is threatening to break up with me if I don t spend time with a crazy old lady Back in the  th grade  we had this math teacher who I ll just call Mrs  K  At the time  I d say she was probably in her late    s and she was definitely an odd one  Whenever a student would come to class with a haircut  she d go out of her way to physically touch their hair  practically rubbing it and complimenting it  She d have a little jar of hard candy on her desk and she would give a piece to students who were well behaved  but she d always say  Suck my candy  whenever she d give one to a student and she would intentionally say it in some weird  almost seductive way  There was one time where she put an open carton of chocolate milk behind the class TV because she wanted to see how long it would take to spoil  It was just little stuff like that that made us all really weirded out by her   But the weirdest thing was when student s Ipods all went missing  There was a point in the middle of the year when everyone s Ipods seemed to vanish from their backpacks  One student claimed to have seen Mrs  K  running to her car after school while holding an armful of Ipods and she became a suspect  Our thought was that since we all have to leave our backpacks in class during lunch and recess  she obviously has easy access to the backpacks left in her class while she has the class to herself  We never did confirm that she was the one who stole them all  but we pretty much just blamed her anyway   Then one day near the end of the year  one kid came to school and he was telling us all about how him and his family came home from shopping over the weekend and they found Mrs  K sitting in their living room and watching Barney and Friends on the TV  We all thought that he was making it up  but just a few days after that  our principal came into class and told us that Mrs  K was leaving due to  health reasons   She didn t elaborate further than that  but she did allude to the Barney situation and simply referred to it as the  incident with a fellow student at his home  The kid whose house that she snuck into pretty much became a celebrity on campus after that and everyone wanted him to retell the story as often as possible  We got a new math teacher to finish off the year and Mrs  K eventually became nothing more than a very strange memory   But just last week  my now girlfriend  we were friends at the time that Mrs  K was teaching  came to me and she said that she saw Mrs  K while shopping  She told me that Mrs  K seemed really sweet  but she s also really lonely and wants more people to spend some time with her  And just a few days after that  my girlfriend DID spend time with her and she said it was a  mostly normal  experience  She apparently told Mrs  K  about how me and her are dating and now Mrs  K  wants to talk with me again  I ve told my girlfriend that that s not happening  but get this  My girlfriend is actually mad at me for not wanting to spend time with her  She says that Mrs  K  is sweet and just wants some friends  but I was weirded out by her and I didn t want to see her  Now my girlfriend is threatening to break up with me because I m an  insensitive asshole   How do I deal with this situation

45,0,My boyfriend    M  admitted that he started dating me    F  just so he could attend his ex girlfriend s wedding as my date I ve known my boyfriend ever since first year of university  so   years  He used to date this girl  who was also part of our friend circle  In third year  he cheated on her at a party and she immediately broke up with him  Just a month or two later  this girl met another guy and started dating him    A few months before their wedding  my now boyfriend asked me out on a date  I had feelings for him for quite some time so I said yes  We started going out  When the wedding invitations came out  he wasn t invited  So he convinced me to take him to the wedding as his plus one  I asked him why he even wanted to attend the wedding  and he said he just wanted to get together with all our friends  He even asked the bride  his ex  for her blessing and he told me she was cool with it    So I took him  The wedding was a year ago  I should have known something was up because the bride made a face when she saw him  and she didn t speak to either of us the whole night  I didn t think more of it  Yesterday  I had lunch with the bride since she was visiting my city  She asked me if I was still dating my boyfriend  and I said yes  She said   Im glad you re happy  it was weird seeing him at my wedding because I didn t know you were dating him  but you two looked so great together     I told her I thought my boyfriend had asked if it was okay for him to attend her wedding  She looked at me weirdly and said he never spoke to her about it  Later  at home  I asked my BF to give me the truth and he confessed that yes  originally  he lied to me so I could bring him as his date to his ex s wedding  He said he was still not over her at the time  but that he is      over her now and only has feelings for me    So basically the only reason he started dating me was so he could get into his ex s wedding  But he swears he s with me now because he s grown to genuinely care for me  in his words    What should I do  I do think he s telling the truth about loving me but I can t get over the real reason why he asked me out    TL DR  Bf confessed that the true reason he asked me out was so he could get into my friend  his ex girlfriend  s wedding 
46,0,My    F  boyfriend    M  had a mostly emotional affair with someone we both worked with  lied about it  and continued to pursue it after we re committed to each other Strap in kids  this is going to be a very long post    I started dating my boyfriend in earlyish       We both worked at the same office  We instantly connected  started off as sort of FWB as we didn t want the rest of the office to know  We continued like this for five months  I had asked him many times what we were doing  and considered ending it because I felt like sometimes I was just a rebound    Cut forward to five months later  we ve met each others families  he s moved into my house  he s told me he loves me  we are boyfriend and girlfriend  the office knows  We ve been on trips together  we re living and working together  Things are working out fine    Now  on to the issues  I was diagnosed with chronic depression prior to meeting him  I take anti depressants and I also take birth control  both of which don t help with any libido that I might have  His libido is quite higher than mine  We had conversations where he has said that he doesn t feel attractive to me and I have tried my best to be more initiative of intimacy  but to be honest  it is something that I have always struggled with  I also struggle with being open about communication  I find it hard to have emotional conversations  I am also trying to work through this    Earlier this year  our office welcomed a new female colleague  She was young and attractive  I was partially in charge of training her  My boyfriend has always been overly friendly with new colleagues  be it male or female  so I paid it no mind when he was equally friendly with her  Turns out they were flirting from the beginning  until someone told her that we were dating  She immediately stopped contact    Cut forward another two months  My boyfriend has quit his job and is planning to go abroad for work and school  While he sits at our home and I go to work  he again begins contacts with our female colleague and begins an emotional affair    From what I learned afterwards  he made it seem like he was in an emotionally abusive relationship  that I didn t find him attractive  that I was only with him for his money etc  He complained to her about me  He told her he was going to break up with me  He talked about how he wanted to have   sex with her   I could tell that he hadn t been acting like his normal self but every time I asked him  he chalked it up to being worried about his move    The weekend of his move  I decided I had had enough  We had never discussed if we were going to do long distance  what was going to happen when he went away  I lay everything down on the table  He told me he was feeling disconnected from me for a long time  We cried  it was a two day conversation where ultimately we decided that we loved each other and we were going to make it work when he went away  Keep in mind  at this point  I still had no idea about his conversations with my colleague    On our last two days together  we went out and had a wonderful dinner  We spent every moment together  I brought him to the airport and I cried as I watched him go through security    Twenty four hours later  I find out everything  During our last few hours together   he was still messaging her asking her to hang out so he could see her again  As I stood there crying at the airport  he was messaging her telling her that if they were ever in the same country again  he would love to take her out  Through the help and support of my best friend  I unravelled everything  I had conversations with my colleague where she was very open and honest with me  She showed me screenshots  She told me that he made me out to be very controlling and cold  From   what I can gather  there was nothing anything physical except for one kiss  which I don t want to minimize but I feel like the emotional affair has hurt me more   I think he lied to her as much as he lied to me    I confronted him over the phone  At the beginning he denied everything until I showed him the screenshots  I broke up with him  I told him I was not going to be treated like that    Now he is saying that he made the biggest mistake of his life  he wants me back  he wants to work on things  He wants to go to counseling if that would make things better  He is willing to move countries to be together    All of his words seem very fine and dandy  but I am so hurt  I was made to feel worthless  He wants to rebuild trust but I honestly don t see how that could happen  This is now two relationships in a row in which a boyfriend has lied to me about other girls and I am tired of being second best    I haven t sen him since this all happened about a month ago and will have no opportunity to see him for another three weeks  The fact that we are currently on different continents and different time zones is not helping matters in terms of discussing things and getting over things    Is there even a point to seeing and talking in person with him in three weeks  Or should I let things lie where they are  and start to move on   TL Dr   My boyfriend had an emotional affair that I only found out about as we became long distance  We will only have the opportunity to see each other in another month  should I meet up with him or let things lie   
47,0,Me    F   dating    M  with a brain injuryI m    y o woman and I ve been dating this    y o guy for awhile and of course  he s had a brain injury  He just had a brain injury three years ago and he s still recovering in his own ways  On top of it  he has epilepsy too  It doesn t exactly affect him in the stereotypical way that many would assume  He can function normally  but at just a little slower paced than others  I really like this guy and we get along great  but lately I ve been feeling really lonely and I don t know if I should bring it up because I feel like it s not validated  Maybe he s just spacing himself because of new medications or that he s stressed tired from other things in his life  I don t want to add to that  you know  I don t think it should be a problem to bring up between us because I don t want it to be another burden in his shoulders if he doesn t feel the same  but it s been taking a toll on me emotionally      What should I do  How should I bring this up  Do you think I should wait

49,0,Afraid to share my    M  sexual past with other men and prostitutes When I was    years old    years ago   I traveled to Europe  and had sex with   separate female prostitutes   I also went through a bicurious phase during the same period of time  where I had casual sex with   different men   I was single during those times   However  I never caught any STDs      amp  x   B   I am starting to date again  but I am afraid of sharing my sexual past   I feel like it would scare off and disgust a majority of the women out there   Does anyone here have a similar experience with their sexual past  and have shared it with a significant other   If so  how did they react 
50,0,Confusing ex gf  Please read the whole story  Really need an opinion on this Hey  i feel so confused about my ex gf s feelings  She broke up with me almost   months ago mainly because of depression  anxiety  low self confidence etc  She is seeing a therapist now    The first month after the break up was really confusing because she wanted to stay friends  But she still told me she had feelings for me and gave me mixed signals ablout getting back togheter in the future or not  Once at a party she called me and wanted me to come  She was a little tipsy so idk why i took her seriously   She got in my car  told me she still wanted to get back with me when she was better mentally and we kissed  The day after she told me she regretted all of it because she was  drunk      or   week later she asked me to pick her up at a friends house  I decided to pick her up  and this time i told her that no romantic initiation would come from me  if she wanted she had to initiate it  She gave me a hug for picking her up and told me i give the best hugs and that she only felt comfertable hugging me  She also said it was hard not to hold my hand  cuddle with me and kiss me  I asked her if she wanted to get over me or not  Yes and no  she replied  Aftee that she started to touch my face and hair and then kissed me  We then drove to my place and had sex but we agreed that the sex would not mean anything  stupid of me to even agree because it meant a lot to me    She kept giving me mixed signals telling me we were never getting back togheter in one moment and telling me she would be open for it in the next  When i asked her if she was open for it or not she told me she was always open for it but didn t want to give me false hope so she didn t tell me    Some time passes and we stay friends for a little while  I wanted to be more than friends and she didn t  I was being needy  desperate and it stressed her  Skipping forward a bit i told her i didn t want to be in this situation anymore  i love her and would have given it another try and work things out  but if she change her mind she could let me know  I cut contact after that    She kept snapchatting me but i had to ignore it seeing as it s not fair to me to be just friends when i want something more      weeks ago i was at a party  she snapchatted me and because i was drunk i answered  We snapped back and forth and ended up in a stupid discussion about she not understanding how i felt since she was the one who broke up when i didn t want that  The next day she decided to cut contact because she told me that the way i acted was bad for her health    One week go by and i contacted her  stupid i know   The conversation went ok i thought  we talked normally about normal stuff  The next day i asked her if i could talk to her about something which could be positive for us both  She told me she didn t know because i apparantly gave her anxiety for talking to me the day before  She told me to write what i wanted to say in the chat so i did  I basically told her how i had realized my mistakes and how i acted towards her was wrong and i hoped she could forgive me and maybe we could talk normally again as friends    Long story short she told me she didn t want to because she was afraid to be manipulated into something she didn t want and that she didn t feel good when we were togheter even though i know that s not true    and a half year togheter and everything she told me  how close we were proves otherwise    I asked if she was lying and faking the relationship since she told me she didn t feel good being with me and she replied  stop laying the blame on me   Last thing i told her before she blocked me on snapchat was that i didn t want her to see me as a bad  person or making other people think so  She had apparantly already told her friends i was  manipulating  and gave her  anxiety     We haven t spoken in   days now  It s hard for you people to give answers on this when not knowing our relationship  But i was always kind  supported her on everything and if we had problems i tried to communicate with her and fix the problem rather than break up  maybe that s were she felt she got manipulated into being with me when i simply tried to talk about or problems and fix them    I admit my mistakes after the break up  pushing her  being needy  desperate and talking about getting back togheter was very stupid of me so i get why she didn t want to talk to me anymore for those reasons  But i got really hurt when she called me manipulative  gave her anxiety and that she didn t have a good relationship with me when everything she has done and told me while being with me proves otherwise  Ofc we had fights from time to time  ups and downs where one of us got hurt and said some stupid things but who doesn t    Now im stuck feeling like im the one and only problem in the relationship that we had and i blame myself for everything  Help please

56,0,Is it time for me    M  to finally seek any sort of retribution against a coworker  late   s F  who is trying to hurt me for an EXCEPTIONALLY petty ass reason Last year around this time I quit my job as creative director for a medium sized ad agency in my city because the CEO called me a  faggot who likes poetry   in front of some clients    I had just gotten married to a really awesome girl and had some savings and we agreed that if this CEO kept up her crazy abusive behavior I would leave  So I left   I do enjoy a good poem from time to time  in case you re wondering    In about two weeks of my search  a designer buddy of mine from a previous job gives me a call  He has an interview for a large project for this mattress company that just moved into town  He wants me to be the writer and he will be the designer for what basically amounts to a full website overhaul   We land the gig  but my buddy doesn t take the assignment too seriously  With good reason  I think  as his talents are far beyond what they needed  Well  at the end of the off site project I m offered regular part time work     hours a week on site  by the mattress company s CMO in an email  I tell him yes  I m stoked I start   Mind you  I ve only been on site maybe   times at this point  I don t know what I m about to walk into    Just so happens at this time that my wife and I find out she s pregnant  Things couldn t be better    Two weeks go by  however  I haven t heard from the mattress company s HR or the CMO  I m starting to think well fuck  This guy isn t gonna hold to his word  Wife says I should keep looking  so I do   Sure enough  a VPN company is interested in me as the head of  community development   a job that would ve put me on Reddit all day   in a business capacity   I m clearly on Reddit all day anyway   They offer me a job  I m not a tech writer per se  and with their larger corporate feel I m clearly not moving up there and honestly making Reddit into work sounds dreadful so I m hesitant  But wife is pregnant  remember  The job at the mattress company would pay more  I haven t been un jobbed or whatever  Finally I get on Facebook and ask a public group of fellow marketers in my city what to do  Totally respectful tone  just asking  My wife says  What if somebody there sees it and misreads it   Sure  Okay  I take the post down within   minutes    The CMO of the mattress company calls me back finally a few days later  He s basically like  What the fuck   about the post  I m taken aback  He quotes me verbatim  I m thinking how the fuck did he see this thing in the   goddamn minutes it was up  on a Thursday night  in a city he doesn t even live in  where people post a question like mine every five minutes  Am I seriously the unluckiest fucker ever   I explain to him what s going on  he calms down and he agrees to meet with me in my city   We meet  I get the job  A trial period for six months then I m on full time   Day    I start and I m placed beside a girl we ll call D  She looks familiar  Turns out we had met each other two years prior at a bar  I said I didn t remember her though I kinda did    When I went home to see how I knew her  I saw that D was a Facebook friend of mine  One of those people who never posts so you don t remember they re around    Then it made sense how the CMO got my post  When my FB friends write in that particular group  I get a notification  D must ve gotten a notification and like a fucking psycho taken a screencap and sent it to the CMO  He had mentioned that  some people  were in  an uproar   I m like why dude  He had shrugged    I m thinking this whole time why would D go out of her way like that   I look up our chat history for clues    As fate would have it  two years prior I had asked her for her number  got it and then never called her  As fate would have it times two  I had met the woman who would become my wife two days after and that whole thing took off like a rocket    Is that why D was so upset  Really  I guess it s possible  I still can t wrap my head around it   In the interest of keeping my job  I bury this news and play nice  The CEO is my boss and she loves my work so things go smoothly for all six months  Then  she heads off for maternity leave  My wife and I have our own lovely little daughter and I only take basically a week off to ensure my job is there when I get back  That s it    The CMO delegates the responsibility of my check being signed when the CEO is away to goddamn D  who also is now in charge of my writing    D is a failed writer  She is objectively not good    She hacks up my work    I have trouble getting my checks signed    I go to the CMO and talk to him   Hey how about that whole sixth month deal we had  It s about time for me to come on full time   He jovially says yes let s talk  I try to bring up that D is a bad writer  casually asking that they test my stuff against her edits  He shrugs and says that is really the CEO s call  She will figure it out when she gets back  That s the end of our phone chat   CMO flies in from New York  I finally tell D  thinking that she possibly can t be angry after basically never raising a single iota of complaint against her or whatever  that I have a meeting with the CMO  that with the baby I really need this job and that I d sincerely appreciate her saying good things to him for me    They go to lunch together   I meet with the CMO at the end of the day  and wouldn t you know it  He fires me  No real explanation  other than an implication that I don t do anything there at all  I do   He s even kinda pissy  He asks me not to tell anybody about me leaving yet   So clearly the CMO has changed his tune on a dime  D doesn t ask me the next day how the meeting went  I suspect she knows why   All of this because I never called her  I hardly talk to this lunatic and she s gone out of her way to try to get me fired twice    My wife is pissed on my behalf  She s telling me I can t just let D win  I need to tell her off  she says  I kinda agree    I m torn between just leaving or sending our chat history to the CEO with a brief explanation of the events with this new bit of information they clearly don t know    Or of course there may be a better alternative  That s why I m coming to you  Reddit   What do you make of this  What should I do  Any help is appreciated  and thanks for the long read

58,0,I    M  was told by my wife    F  that she had an affair overseas   months ago  I dont know if I should reconcile or leave My wife of   years and partner of   years told me   months ago that she had an affair with someone while she went on a trip overseas  It lasted for   days followed by   months of messaging  The day she told me was the day she decided to stop messaging the other person      months after being told what happened I am still on the fence about what to do  She is going to therapy  working on her self esteem issues and insecurity  shows remorse every day  and is making drastic changes to her behaviour and how she treats our relationship  She also doesn t make any excuses for why she did it  Before she went away we had been going through ups and downs  but I thought this was just a typical experience of marriage and long relationships  It has come out in marriage counselling and her own therapy that she felt trapped and deeply depressed by our relationship during that time but didn t know what to do  She said she felt trapped because she thought I did not want her to pursue further studies or change careers  During our counselling she now understands that I did not care if she wanted to do that and it came down to poor communication by both of us  She says everyday she regrets not communicating this feeling and wishes she went to therapy earlier  She is even telling me that I can sleep with other people if it would help me move on and reconcile after I initially said I wanted a divorce during a big argument  which was something I said in the heat of the moment    I just feel a bit stuck  On one hand I want to reconcile but on the other hand I feel like I should just move on despite the love I still have for her  Any advice or personal stories would greatly be appreciated  
59,0,I    M  am breaking up with my girlfriend    F  after she comes back from vacationMy girlfriend of   years has been gone on vacation with her family for the last week or so  We ve been going through a rough couple of months in this time and have gone through some ups and downs in our relationship  We ve been talking a lot about how to improve and have been working to make the relationship better but it s still been a struggle    This week that she s been gone has been pretty liberating  and it s helped me realize that I don t want to be in the relationship any longer  I felt happier being alone and not having to worry about responsibilities of the relationship   Any ways  I already told her I was going to pick her up from the airport tonight  The question I have is if I already know that I m going to break up with her  should I be breaking up with her at   pm on a Thursday night after she s come back from vacation  Or should I wait for a better time like the next day or the weekend  I feel bad doing it at a weird time like that  but then I also don t want to keep going with the relationship as if nothing s wrong when I know this  Maybe I m just nervous about breaking up since this is my first time with someone I really care about  so I m trying to push it off  Idk what do you guys think   TL DR Should I break up with my girlfriend right after she gets back from vacation when I pick her up from the airport  Is this a bad time or am I just rationalizing it that way in my head because I m nervous 
60,0,My boyfriend    M  has never asked me    F  to be his girlfriend officially  we ve been going out for almost   years now   is it wrong to be feeling insecure about this I ll be honest here  this is probably the longest relationship my boyfriend has ever held  I m also not experienced in dating either and was in   toxic relationships previously  each lasted about    yrs   This hasn t been smooth sailing  but it is the healthiest one I ve experienced so far and I am really grateful for having him  He is brutally honest and has an upright character  super smart and outgoing   all of the things I love    The only thing that s dragging me down  emotionally  is how he rarely gives reassurances when I really need to hear them  He has flipped out before when I asked  are you sure   or  is this ok   because he thinks I should already know or that he will tell me if he changes his mind  Asking him for reassurances bother him and not hearing those from him makes me uneasy insecure and I wonder if it s because he has never asked me to be his gf officially  We still make time to go out on dates  roughly once a week  and attend friend s events together  but sometimes I feel like we re just there separately and not as a couple  Sometimes the chemistry is good  but sometimes I feel like it isn t there  I still have questions about where we stand but I m too terrified to ask because I don t want him to get mad over it   Wondering if any of you experienced similar situations  and is it that important for him to pop the question  Maybe I m overanalyzing all of these and it s just feelings of inadequacy getting to my head      amp  x   B 
61,0,How do I    m  set boundaries with ny gf    f  without being controlling Sorry for formatting  as I m on mobile   TL DR My gf goes out to drink many hours longer than she says she will with no communication  and tonight ended up sleeping in a frat house   So  my girlfriend and I have been dating for around   months now  and most of the time  everything is great  We share a lot of interests and enjoy the time we spend together  We go to the same college  spend nights at each other s places  and she s of legal drinking age and I m not  important to the situation     However  she s made a habit of going out to the bars and telling me she s going to be a few hours  then coming home in the wee hours very drunk and needing to be taken care of  Going out is not the problem for me  it s the communication  Once she leaves  it s radio silence until she gets back  sometimes   or   hours  This makes me very upset and frustrated  as I m left at home with nothing to do but wait to hear from her   The specific incident that just happened was similar  but when the bars closed at    she went with a female friend to a frat house to keep drinking  I wasn t made aware of this  and was trying to get in contact her until   when she texted me saying she was sleeping and asking for me to pick her up  This set me over the edge as I don t find it acceptable for her to be vulnerable in that setting    Whenever we discuss these incidents  I express that going out is fine  I just expect some form of communication so I don t have to wait and wonder  She doesn t take this well and thinks I want to be controlling  If I m honest with myself  sometimes I get upset and we fight  but it s just so frustrating to me  I don t mean or want to be angry with her   So  how do I set the boundaries that I need without being controlling  I really love this girl and want things to work out with her  I m just beside myself with this issue  Other than this  we have a great relationship and I don t want it to be ruined

67,0,Feeling Super Conflicted About Reaching Out To My   F  Ex   M Here s the back story  I broke up with my ex   months ago because I didn t see a future together  We dated for   months and I will say those were some of the best times of my life but also some of the most stressful times  He was such an amazing and talented guy  He was kind  gentle  caring and compassionate  He knew the little things that makes me happy like random back rubs  surprise flowers and chocolate  We would always look forward to seeing each other and going on adventures together  The main cause of stress was some cultural differences with both our families  There was definitely heavy pushback from his side of the family initially that bothered me since the start  Having dated outside of my ethnicity previously  I knew this was a possibility and I was willing to give it a shot  He was honest about the situation and reassured me that things will work out after some time    amp  x   B   After months of little progress  I decided that he wasn t the right guy for me and I had to call it off  Obviously he wanted to keep trying but I didn t want to potentially cause a rift between him and his family  Even though we both loved each other and talked about future plans  I thought it was best that we split up    amp  x   B   Since the breakup  he s contacted me twice to repair the relationship but I turned him away each time  For the most part we both have been respectful in giving each other space    amp  x   B   Several days ago  I was out with a group of mutual friends and overheard his name being brought up  Since then I ve been thinking about him  I know that he has moved away  for a new job but nothing else besides that  He does not use social media so I have no idea of his well being  I m also afraid to ask our mutual friends because I know he took the break up hard initially     amp  x   B   I am conflicted because I love the man but he didn t provide the security I want  Maybe he has realized this and the situation has changed  Maybe we should have communicated better  I don t want to get in a situation where either of us gets hurt again  Is it selfish of me to reach out when maybe he is moving along on his healing process and I am just opening old wounds   I miss him and I don t know if I even have the right to contact him after rejecting him on multiple occasions    amp  x   B   Has anyone here been in similar situation like this 
68,0,I    M  am planning to break up with my girlfriend    F   but least night she said she tried to kill herself two days ago Some backstory  My girlfriend and I have been together almost   years  I love her very much  but we ve had issues lately and while I want nothing more than to make it work  I don t think it will anymore  I live with her family as they live about   minutes away from the university we both go to   The exact reason i want to break up is not necessary important  but basically we ve had a few arguments that have made us slowly drift apart  and every time I feel things are starting to turn around  something happens that undoes all that and then some  The tipping point was probably last night  when she exploded at me out of no where for everything that s been going on  and I thought to myself  I m going to leave tomorrow morning   We were both drunk and I had no way home  otherwise I probably would have ended things on the spot    In the middle of everything last night  however  she told me that that while i was at home with my family the night before  she had taken an entire sleeve of her antidepressants  about    pills  before throwing them up later   I didn t know how to react  If I leave her will she be ok  I told her that if she doesn t tell her parents and or talk to a therapist and book an appointment the next day I will tell them for her and she flipped out  She said that wasn t my place and she would go to the police for telling her parents something like that  whatever the fuck that means  I told her to go ahead    I don t know what to do  I love her and care about her but I m unhappy in our relationship  but I don t know how I could possibly leave her after hearing that  I d never forgive myself if something happened 
69,0,My    m  girlfriend    f  is eztremely flaky for our dates Hey guys  I m on my phone so apologies in advance if my formatting is not correct  For the record we have been dating for around   months and use to see each other     times a week     Basically  over the past   weeks my girlfriend has started to become super flaky for our dates  It started with her saying  yeah  maybe we can do that   and the day it happens she would always say  oh I m tired  or  work was hard  I just want to go home and veg out  which I totally get  but I want to see her and recently I ve only been able to see her once a week  if I m lucky   I talked about it with her this week when she on a whim asked me to grab drinks with her and some co workers  and she told me that between work and the gym  she doesn t want to hangout on weekdays so she can concentrate on her goals  I totally support that and told her so    Cue today  I ask if she wants to do anything now that it s the weekend and see if she is available today or tomorrow  She tells me she already has plans tonight and all day tomorrow and  maybe Sunday evening if I have time   I feel like I m inconveniencing her when I ask her out and she isn t trying to make the relationship work  Should I tell her this or what should I do  
70,0,I  F     am planning to walk away from a relationship with my partner  M     and I need reassurance I unfortunately wasted many years of my life with the wrong people in the wrong relationships  I was with someone for   years and it didn t work out  and I m just about to walk away from a   year relationship because we just can t seem to make it work  I love him  but there are aspects to him that I can t deal with and I just think while the love is there  we re just not compatible    I m worried about being single at     I worry I won t find someone in time  I very much want to settle down and have a family and it scares me to death to have to start this process all over again    I guess I m just looking for reassurance that at    I can still find a loving partner and eventually have a family  I see people my age or older being single and they re totally fine  but deep down inside I worry that I will end up staying in a relationship because I m scared I m getting older and reaching an age where I won t be able to have children in time  
71,0,Uncomfortable with GF s friend  Am I being controlling I  M    have been with my girlfriend  F    for about     months now  Things have been going well other than some rough bumps in the start  She makes me extremely happy and I feel a great connection with this girl but recently I ve felt a little disrespected and concerned about a certain issue    A month and a half ago she went out to a neighboring city for a party and reconnected with some of her ex s roommates  One had asked her to be a part of a threesome which made me really uncomfortable but she made sure to stay clear of that guy  Eventually I discovered that nearly all of these roommates were trying to hook up with her  They were snap chatting her pretty consistently but she never let me know what they were saying  She ended up removing one of them from her friends list one night  I later found out that guy had said something to her on snap chat from a DM I saw where he apologized for what he said and that it  was a joke   She doesn t know that I know this    Recently there has been another one of the roommates  This time she s talking to this guy a lot  He mentioned to her that he was surprised he didn t make a move on her at the party and also invited her to come visit him at a house he was house sitting for out in my area  I have told her that I m uncomfortable with her talking to this guy because he clearly wants something with her but she plays it off like he s just a friend and hasn t said anything I disapprove of  It also doesn t help that she sometimes tries to make me jealous by bringing up guys that she knows I have an issue with    Is it wrong for me to step in and say that I m uncomfortable and would rather he not talk to this guy  I don t want to be controlling but how much they are talking to each other  knowing his intentions  is starting to get to me  
72,0,I     F  used to be a prostitute  Then I met a man who became my friend     M  at a cafe  Now I have my GED and am a receptionist I have a child with cystic fibrosis  I would watch him during the day and work at night  My sister lived with us and she would watch him at night    I would go to a cafe before I started work for a half hour and have a latte and have time to myself  My friend was there typing on a laptop  We started talking and I found out he came every day to write a book in his spare time and he was in the publishing business    I told him I never finished high school and he said he d help me get my GED  The next day he brought me some books published by where he worked  He helped me study and I passed    He helped me get a job as a receptionist   I can afford better care for my child    We are still friends and I have fallen in love with him  I m not sure if he could ever like me in that way    Is it worth asking him if he does or Not  Or do you think that would ruin our friendship   I m not sure he would want to be with me because of my past    Edit  he knows about my past and he knows and gets along with my child 
73,0,My    m  fiance    f  left me one day asking for space and hasnt spoke to meSo bit of background I have struggled with depression  alcohol and aggression and   years ago attempted suicide  She was with me through it all and helped me through it  since then I put my happiness in her instead of myself and I ve been a drain on her emotionally as well as aggressive whilst drunk  never hit her or anything  but I was mentally abusive whilst drunk and very needy   controlling    I didn t see that I ve been doing this until she left me    weeks ago  and I took control of my life    I ve since stopped drinking  am working on my happiness and take control of my own situation  By acknowledging what lead me to suicide I have since stated talking to my family and went over my past friendships that I had ruined and apologised to them all    Im now in such a better place for this    But she still won t talk to me about anything  She took my two dogs and left me in a foreign country alone  I understand she needs time but how long before I can show her I am the man that she can rely upon rather than the man I was    I want her back not because I need her in my life but because I want her in my life  
74,0,My girlfriend    F  is happy with almost every aspect of our relationship  But due to some dumb actions on my    M  part  she isn t sexually attracted to me anymore We ve been together for almost a year and a half  and things have been great for the most part  She has depression and anxiety which causes problems on its own  When we first started dating  she was unmedicated  After a bad experience with Effexor a few years prior  she tried combating it on her own  However  shortly into our relationship  I could see that it wasn t working as well as either of us were hoping  I recognized the potential within her that she could be so much happier if she had a more stable psyche  I wanted to be supportive in helping her get treatment  and she tried all different kinds of meds  We both knew that one of the major side effects of most antidepressants is low to no libido  But we were determined not to let that ruin things  After being in a past relationship with someone who had depression  I d already gone down the  not very much sex  road  So I was used to it    amp  x   B   She has had a number of experiences with sexual abuse dating back to when she was     and then again in adulthood when dating around  She s never felt very empowered  and tends to submit to abusers in the moment before never contacting them again  I am not the kind of person to force myself on anyone  and I pride myself in that  Before she told me about how many experiences she d had with guys who build up her trust only to take advantage of her  I didn t realize just how common it is  It took her a while to fully trust in me that I would never do anything like that to her  There were many times early on when she would get these panicky episodes out of the blue when things started getting hot and heavy  And every time  I d be patient and understanding  never showing frustration that things wouldn t progress past making out  Once she was able to trust me  our sex life was fantastic  Her meds were hit and miss a lot of the time concerning her libido  depending on what she was trying at the time  Eventually  it got to the point where we didn t have sex as often  and she felt bad for rejecting me  Being who she is  and enjoying every other aspect of what we had  I was wiling to only have sex when she initiated it  to make her feel better    amp  x   B   I grew up with a father who was very loving  fun  funny  and inappropriately narcissistic  I d always been around him making sexual jokes at inappropriate times and picked up on some of his tendencies  Luckily  I was able to identify in my late teens and early   s that this behavior wasn t right  so I ve worked my hardest not to behave that way  I know now that this is a major contributing factor to his countless failed relationships  and I don t want to go down that road  However  there s one thing that s been made apparent that I do which can arguably be traced back to that aspect of my upbringing  I will playfully  yet impulsively grab my girlfriend s breasts at unwarranted times  I ll preface by saying that I know there is no justification or excuse for my actions  but according to her  this is one of two roots to the problem    amp  x   B   Being a victim of sexual abuse  there are so many things that she is sensitive about  Things that I hadn t really considered  Playfully grabbing her breasts is one of them  I m stupid in not realizing it sooner  Initially  I thought that her annoyance from it was due to her medication making her physically sensitive  and nothing more  Just typing it out  I m now realizing just how obvious it is to stop doing something when someone says  Stop   I wouldn t do it to excess  as in  if she told me to stop  I would right then  but I d end up doing it again later  It s worth noting that I also have ADHD  and acting on impulse is something I ve always struggled with    amp  x   B   When she broke the news to me that she was feeling the way she is  she explained that the reason why our sex life has been hurting so bad lately isn t because of low libido  She s finally found a medication that she doesn t think affects her that way  She wants to have sex  but she doesn t want to have sex with me  I asked her how long she d been feeling this way  and she said that it s been for at least the last two months  She just didn t know how to explain it    amp  x   B   She knows I m not a bad person  nor do I act out of malice  She loves being weird with me  indulging in mutual middle school guilty pleasure bands movies  she sees the value of the life we ve begun to build together  we re best friends  But when you view someone like that who also makes you feel disrespected and violated  it triggers some of the feelings she had with previous abusers  The second reason why she can t bring herself to have sex with me anymore is more or less the icing on the cake  Apparently  there s a certain face I would make when we were having sex that reminds her of one of her abusers  She had mentioned that to me one time  and I made a conscious effort not to make that face  However  any time she thinks about having sex with me  she just gets those feelings again and is immediately turned off    amp  x   B   She told me this two days ago and said that she hasn t made any decisions yet  But she is afraid that this may be something that s irreversible  With that being the case  breaking up is what she thinks is best to avoid ending things on a sour note  Knowing the severity of what I was doing  I ve promised to her that I ll never touch her in any unwarranted way again    amp  x   B   I just want to know if there s anything that can be done to correct this  I ve told her that whatever decision she makes  I ll honor  but if there s anything I can do to make it right  I want to be able to do it  I love this woman so much  and to think that I ve hurt her this way just kills me    amp  x   B     TL DR     amp  x   B   Playfully grabbing my girlfriend s breasts in unwarranted situations has triggered her to view me as a violator in sexual situations and has an aversion to engaging in sex with me  It took her two months to say it  but it s caused her to become sexually frustrated because she still loves every other aspect of our relationship  but not being able to have sex with a partner causes a rift that may be irreversible  I just want to know if there s anything I can do or say to help make this right 
75,0,How to be nice without leading people on I    f  like writing with people  Getting to know them better online  just because I m curious about what they think and who they are  Because in real life I m a pretty anxious person and that way I can interact with people more and it makes me happy to be able to talk to various people    The problem is  almost all the people I write with for some time  a few months  end up wanting to date me    guys so far and   girl   I m bisexual but I have never been in a physical relationship with anyone    At this point I know the person a bit and  in most cases  I really like them  but not in a romantic way  Two times I agreed to be in a relationship with people  who confessed  but I never loved them and even though I tried my best and truly cared about them  I couldn t make myself lie about my feelings and any idea of sex with them grossed me out  No feelings for them developed during both times of dating  I tried my best  but I was slowly losing interest  my mind wandered and I knew I was spiralling down to the blues again    So  my question is  how  and when  do I say that I am not interested in them romantically  Sometimes I doubt myself if I even know what romantic love is   that s why I agreed to date even though I didn t love people who suggested dating  I did not feel attracted  What do I do  Please help  I don t want to mislead people or hurt them because of my ignorance 
76,0,My GF is meeting another guyMe      and my girlfriend      of almost   years had a rough time the last   months  We had a pretty big fight  Then she told me that she needed some space and I gave it to her  After one week she said  that she wants to stay together and that we can fix this relationship  We are both studying but at different universities  But we live only    minutes away from each other   Before this fight  we were together       mostly the reason for the fight   Now we are seeing each other maybe   to   times a week   She is not as loving as before and i think that most of the time she does not want to see me   At universitiy she found a guy  who was helping her in math  Quickly they became friends  Thats fine for me  But  yesterday I asked her if she had time to meet up   She said that she does not know if she is free this weekend  because there might be a birthday party and she wanted to see me next week  Then we met yesterday afternoon and she told me  that this saturday she goes drinking with this guy   She also told me  that she does not want to go drinking with me because we dont have anything to tell each other  In my opinion it is not true because when we are together we are talking non stop and we have a lot of fun together  We are laughing most of the time   My fear is  that she has a little bit to much fun with him and decides that our relationship is over  But i am pretty sure  that she does not want anything from him because he is only    years old   Normaly i am not this type of guy who is jealous and even now i am not really jealous  It is more of an fear  I am happy if we both can spend time with our friends  And i really trust her   Have you guys any idea  how i should handle this situation correctely and what i should think about it  How do i get to this point  where it does not ruin my whole weekend   PS  sorry for this long post and my bad english  
77,0,I legitimately want to kill myself Have no idea where else to post this  I m just tired of not doing anything right and ruining all my relationships and I m just to the point where I want to slit my throat and just bleed out    F if that makes a difference  
78,0,How can i  as a woman  be romantic I    F  have this amazing bf    M  who is head over heels for me  I think that he is really romantic  He opens all the doors for me  He always does his best to make me happy  and I try to make him happy  Once a week I stay over during the week and go to work early in the morning  like   hours earlier than him  But he always gets up just to make me lunch and he always puts a lovely note and a pastry in there  Even though he doesn t eat bread aka he goes to the bakery for me    He told me that I am his first true love and quite frankly he is the kind of guy that only says something if he means it  When we go out with people he always  pulls me in his arms  shakes me  a little to show everyone that I am his   Not in an abusive way haha  I am really grateful to have him in my life  I am happy to have a giver after dating so many takers    Now I know that I am just slightly bragging  but I really wanna be romantic as well  but I don t know how     All the bedroom things are amazing and he gets more than he asks for  He is a lucky man as well  I just don t know how to be romantic      Help please  
79,0,What does it mean if my    F  boyfriend    M  said he needs  space   and what can I do  Throw away because my SO uses reddit and knows my original account   What does  space  mean    I should know because I asked for space two months ago because everything just stressed me out and I felt like I couldn t breathe  I don t think that s the kind of space he means though  This sounds like the kind of  space  like  you exhaust me and I don t want to deal with it anymore   It s complicated   The point is this guy is awesome in most ways  except for committing to a relationship  and sometimes communicating  In the beginning  he seemed like all he wanted was open communication  I was very reserved at first because I hate appearing clingy  In one instance  in the first month of talking to each other  his ex girlfriend of   years was visiting  He kept asking me if I was ok with it  and that if I didn t want him to sleep with her  I should say it  I finally got the courage and said that he could do what he wanted because we were not in a relationship  but that I would be upset if he slept with her    To my knowledge  they didn t sleep together  I guess we will never know for sure  but he says he didn t and I believe him  He also texted me when she was with him saying he missed me and wished I was there instead  That felt really nice and reassured me that I found a really awesome guy   Anyways  fast forward   months  We have our issues  He doesn t communicate much to me  so I get suspicious  Turns out those suspicions are sometimes right  but also sometimes wrong and I come across as paranoid and needy  I hate both of those things  and they always lead to clingy ness   Sometimes I overcompensate for appearing clingy by appearing disinterested  when I m really really interested  I don t know which is worse   I m not sure what I m looking for here  Maybe advice on how to cope with someone needing  space   if I m a classic over thinker  Or maybe I m just looking for someone who has been in this position before so I know I m not alone in this weird relationship tango  I m not sure  but I know the reddit community is pretty clever and accepting  so please  what do you think   TLDR  My SO claims he needs  space   I don t blame him because I ve asked for this before  but I think he means it in a different  more serious way than I meant it 
80,0,My    F  boyfriend    M  isn t putting in much effort and I can t tell how serious he is My boyfriend is amazing  he is very kind  caring and I am very happy with him  However  after the  honeymoon  stage of the relationship he has seemed to put a little less effort in  I know he is busy with school and his job but he is not conveying his care as I want to see  We are mid long distance  he lives a   hour bus journey away  and forgets about the phone calls that we schedule due to this    I ended up staying up late as he said he would call me but when we did he said he wanted to sleep and ended the call very quickly  I like chivarly and kind gestures  but this is simply not the way he expresses his care  He compliments me but his actions reflect someone who isn t so keen or serious about the relationship  When we finally do get together  he sits on his phone and says he is tired or makes music and does not seem to make space for us to bond and have meaningful conversations    I in no way intend to break up with him but I am not sure how to communicate my need for more effort in our relationship  How do I express this without seeming overly dramatic or needy  Thank you for whatever response comes from this in advance and I am happy to respond to any questions   
81,0,I      don t know if I like my boyfriend      enough and I feel horrible about it  Is it time to break up  or work on the relationship I always thought that when I met someone it would be obvious to me whether I liked them or not  but with my current boyfriend I honestly can t tell if I like him enough to be in a relationship with him long term  This is not because of anything he ever did  He is a smart  kind  and knows what he wants to do with his life  I always thought that these qualities alone would be enough for me to develop feelings for someone  Despite my lack of dating experience  I have actually had multiple casual  hook up  relationships with people in the past  and I ALWAYS developed feelings for them  It was awful because we would be in a friends with benefits type situation  and I would immediately fall for them  Needless to say  I decided that casual hookups were not my thing  But i really wanted to have an emotional connection with someone other than just the sex  so I decided to try my hand at dating     amp  x   B   I met my boyfriend in an online texting app  and we texted for a few weeks before we met up in person  We have now been together for about a month  The first warning sign came up the first time we kissed  Admittedly  it was his first kiss so I understand that he wasn t immediately going to be great at it  but I honestly felt nothing  I wasn t really excited throughout the kiss  and I was so confused as to why  This worried me because I remember that with my first boyfriend I instantly felt the sexual chemistry between us when we first kissed  but I didn t feel that with my current boyfriend    amp  x   B   So why did I continue to date him if I didn t instantly feel the sexual chemistry  Because we got along so well and he seemed like everything I wanted  yet the issue is that I don t feel infatuated with him the way I felt in past relationships and it s driving me crazy  I definitely like him  the sex is okay  but I don t understand why I don t feel the same about him as I did with past guys who didn t like me back  He is so sweet to me  and he likes me more than anyone has before  but I can t seem to match his enthusiasm for the relationship  I genuinely don t understand it  and it completely breaks my heart  I really do care for him  and the thought of breaking up with him makes me cry because I really wanted this to work out  and I don t want to break his heart  No one ever told me how difficult deciphering your feelings could be  However  sometimes I think to myself   well  possibly my feeling towards him are still growing  so maybe I will grow to like him more   But in the end  I m just left feeling as if I m a horrible person because I was really into pass guys who didn t like me back  but the first guy who is a great guy and really likes me comes along and I can t seem to totally reciprocate his feelings     amp  x   B   Is it even possible for your feelings for someone to grow if you don t have that instant chemistry  More importantly though  why do you think these things happen  We build up an idea in our head of a person that we think we want  but when we find that person it ends up not feeling like we thought it would feel   I am so confused  I like him  but I don t know if I like him enough  
82,0,I    F  am losing motivation for my   year relationship with my bf    M Throwaway for the usual reasons  Tl dr at bottom   amp  x   B   So me and my boyfriend have been together for   year now  this is his first long term relationship   my longest was   years  his was   year  and we ve both only had about two  exclusive  partners in the past   So for the past    months we ve been in whats called  the honeymoon phase   Happy as can be  none of us could do anything wrong and I was more than happy with picking up the slack where needed in the relationship  I had a well paying stable job  he was a waiter finishing his studies   so the driving around and buying food and basically mothering him was fine because I had the impression that all of this would change when he finished his studies in January  After he finished he dabbled in waitering for another month and only started looking for a new job in Feb  which I was annoyed by but I kept my cool because after all  this was his life right   So fast forward quite a bit to him getting a job instantly  getting his first paycheck and me noticing that nothing has changed in terms of him covering the slack I ve picked up  So I spoke to him about it and told him that it s time for him to start making the plans for us to go out and do things and for him to get the food and helping out around the house  I live alone  he doesn t but basically stays in my flat anyway  because I m tired of acting like his mother  He apparently took this really hard and saw it as me telling him he s not good enough for me because he started crying and told me he s sorry and he ll try harder  And he did  Once or twice  Both ending in absolute disaster because he picks places to go but doesn t check their open times or if they have vegetarian options  I m vegetarian  and we usually end up going to places that don t have and I have to sit there and feel sorry for myself    This ordeal made me quite sad because I felt like I put all the effort in and he just tries every now and then and doesn t really care   I then decided to let go of the metaphorical rope and see what would happen if he steers this relationship instead of me  And its been terrible  I feel like I ve given the steering wheel to someone who d rather sit next to the road and wait for someone to pick them up rather than taking charge and putting his own foot on the gas  After this realization I ve lost all my motivation to keep this relationship going on my own and I have no idea what to do  I love him dearly but I m just sad about me doing everything in the relationship    amp  x   B   TLDR  Losing motivation for relationship after realizing that if I don t take all control in it it s not going to go anywhere  
83,0,My    M  Gf    F  broke up with me suddenly out of the blueA little background     My gf and I had been dating for   year and   months and broke up the day after my birthday   We were in an argument the day before my birthday on the   th and it ended badly  On the   th she breaks up with through a   min phone call and tells me that we weren t the right people for each other and that she hasn t felt like she s loved me for a couple months now  At no point in time did I see any indication that our relationship was in turmoil and I never would ve thought in a million years that she would end it like this  I tell her that it s unfair of her to break up with me without giving me a chance to do anything  She tells me that she s given our relationship many chances  but how could she have ever given it any chances without telling me what went wrong  I also tell her that there are   people in a relationship and that it s unfair to end it so one sided  I offer to give her space and that her decision is rash but she says that her decision is final and that it s her life and she gets to decide what she does with it  I just don t see how after over a year she now decides that we aren t the right people for each other  She s been making plenty of new friends lately and I have a terrible feeling that she s maybe met someone else    I m so confused about this whole situation and want to mend things but it s so hard when someone says they do not love you anymore without and indication telling me why she doesn t    TL DR  Gf broke up with saying she doesn t love me anymore without an indication for over a year  
84,0,I    m  and my LDR ex    F  we never met  she dumped me right before our first meeting ever      years relationship I ve loved this woman more than anything in the world  I told her I don t want long distance because it d be painful and it s best we wait until I get to her state before we date  but she insisted that we become GF BF prior to meeting in real life  I went along as I valued her as my best friend and liked her more than anything  this grew into a serious love for her  and she loved me too for     years  afterwards I introduced her to a friend of mine and he wouldn t stop talking to her daily and wanting more  until I told her to break the news to him that we are together and he needs to stop trying  he got mad at her and me and she told him she s not interested  gave him   week away and broke up with me at the same time  then came back to me one day after and broke up with me again  afterwards she came back to me a week later  this was in september last year  First breakup   Second breakup was   weeks ago  I had bought us tickets to travel around hong kong  and indonesia  bali  and to meet for the first time  I paid for all the expenses as I loved her dearly and couldn t wait to see her  she was excited and telling me how much she can t wait to see me and love me and all that    weeks before the flight she went to a night club and told me that she would ve banged every guy in the club if her friends didn t stop her  I got upset at that as I loved her and she told me but I have needs and the distance  I forgave her when she promised me she didn t do anything a day later  we got back to normal  A couple of days later she breaks up with me telling me she can t feel the connection anymore and that she can t connect this  crap with reality   I got super distressed and depressed  I practically begged her to stay  but she just told me I have to respect her decision  I told her we can t be friends as I have too many emotions for you  she said i ll respect that too  even though she wanted to stay as friends   I was super confused overall  I asked her for the money back for her tickets but I realized she can t really pay it with her debt so I told her she dosen t have to pay  she started blocking me in social media as soon as I mentioned her refunding me for her tickets money  as I wanted to pay for all the tickets but I had no idea she would ve broken up with me if I knew that was the case I wouldn t have booked us the tickets   Anyway she started blocking me in most things  I told her to take care of herself and that I love her  and I blocked her in the rest of social media contact except SMS and instagram as I thought she blocked me there already  I texted her   weeks later telling her I miss her a lot and love her and she responded with  I ve already moved on  you sholud move on too for your own good   and that was the last text she ever sent me  I went no contact for   month afterwards  during this period she unblocked me in instagram and watched all my Instagram stories for    days in a row  without commenting or saying a word  She was also one of the first to watch a story every time   I got really confused and felt like she was trying to reconcile or tell me she miss me  I contacted her in whatsapp saying   I m not sure what you were trying to communicate to me by watching my instagram stories every day without following me  I had to block you so I can heal as I was receiving mixed signals and overthinking it    I was hoping that would give her the push to reconcile  but shejust blocked me in whatsapp as soon as I sent her that text  right after reading it  I then broke down and cried and sent her an SMS Telling her i love her and miss her so much right after  I didn t receive a response it s been   days     I was gonna close the distance this year and see her for the first time ever too   I loved her more than anything in the world  and now I m having a hard time not messaging her  but i m trying my best not to  it s really sad I love her so much and I feel extremely lonely as I m in a vacation by myself that I booked for us together  I really wanna contact her and ask her to be my friend again and tell her she s free to date as long as she s willing to give us a try once we meet physically  although I don t think that s a good idea  my heart just feels awful without her

95,0,I think I m falling for my best  and only friend  and I m lost on what to do  I don t wanna lose herI  M       met a girl      online about   months ago  and originally I was just gonna try to get nudes from her and screw around a bit and be on my way  but then I found out she had a boyfriend    Now  normally I d just give up and ghost her because I wasn t looking for anything else  but I figured she might not stay with him for too long and she was pretty enough to wait it out for a little bit    Instead  we became friends  We started playing a game on Facebook where one person answers   questions  and the other guesses their answers and then answers two of their own  We got to know each other better    Eventually I opened up to her  and decided to take a chance and trust her   Now  I don t have much in the way of friends and she s the only one I talk to on a mostly daily basis  but even my few other friends I don t trust with much  Eventually it got to the point where I was comfortable telling her things nobody else knew about me    She started opening up about her relationship  telling me things in casual conversation  like one day I was joking about her boyfriend  I ll play gay for him just for a laugh  and she bought up that he s below average  and she tells me about things he does that she doesn t like  Recently she opened up about her doubts about the relationship because he s a total pushover and when he s not  he s too aggressive with trying to get some from her    As soon as we became friends I stopped looking at her sexually  and she knew I wasn t interested in her  So one day she was telling me how she wished she was thinner and I told her she looked great how she was  she s a tiny  tiny bit chubby  just enough to have the nice sized thighs most people like nowadays  She said she wanted to send me a picture of her from a couple years ago when she was thinner but all the ones that showed it were things like her showing off underwear for her now ex  I told her I didn t look at her that way  and she decided she was comfortable enough with it  I was pretty fine with it and gave her an honest opinion    Well  about   months later  less than a week ago  she told me she was feeling really cute in her new underwear but her boyfriend was too busy playing video games to respond to her pictures with anything other than a  cute   so I volunteered   I don t look at you as more than a friend  but I ll give you honest opinions on how you look  and she sent me a few pictures of her butt and a few concerns and I told her she looked great  because wow she looked incredible   She s told me that even if I liked her  I m friend zoned hard enough she could change in front of me and feel fine   A few months ago we decided that I d drive down to visit her  from Washington to Illinois  in the summer  And we ve been getting excited because it s getting closer   But lately  I ve been thinking about her a lot more  I joking told her I loved her as a friend  loved having someone I trust in my life  and she said she loved me too  as a friend  When I say I missed her she either laughs and calls me a weirdo or says she missed me too  She s even come to me for the decision of which picture of her and her college class to hang up on her wall first  Tonight  we hadn t talked much in about   days because she s been busy  and she messaged me  hey  I miss you  what s up   And we talked  But then I said things  we disagree on A LOT of stuff  and she went to bed because she was sick of dealing with my shit  long day at work and a few other things probably didn t help either   But she s been getting lazy with texting because she s tired  and just started sending voice clips  and I find myself listening to them more than once just because her voice helps me feel calm  and safe  And I like seeing her smile  And I miss talking to her   I almost texted her tonight  I don t think I should come down for my trip this summer  and I don t know if I would have said  I think I m falling for you and I don t think this would help  or  I don t know if our friendship can last that long  but they were both options in my mind  The thing is  I can t do just friends with someone who knows I like them  it always gets awkward  But I can t get this girl out of my head and I m so fucking terrified I m going to lose my best friend because of this    Please     What do I do 
96,0,Boyfriend    M  facing crisis in his life and I m    F  at a loss because I m hurting him moreHi  this is my first time posting and I really need some perspective but I don t really want people in real lief to know I m going through this  My parents aren t aware I m in a relationship either  I m not very good at articulation so I understand this may be confusing  Also  I feel like a mess but do just be honest with your views so I can get it straight      amp  x   B   So this started two weeks ago  during my one week school holiday which is right before my first exams of the year  Some context  I m sitting for the biggest exam of my life that basically determines my whole future at the end of this year but I haven t been the best student even though I m supposedly in the top institution of my country  This year is really my last year to catch up and I really wanted to start this year right by passing everything in every exam  However  at the same time  my boyfriend of almost   years was struggling with the career he wants to continue in future  forex trading  and studies that his mom forced him to take up again  His original plan was to just put aside studying and just pursue his career choice but this is really unconventional in the asian society I am in and as a middle class family for him  So of course his mother was vehemently against it at first  wanting him to complete his studies  which is seen as the only way to success in life in my country  But he was persistent and his mom gave up and just decided to make him study while he does his thing  It was smooth sailing at first  he really tried his best for both  he was doing well for both  Yeah  then the pressure to juggle both studies and forex got onto him and he lost quite a bit of money and things went downhill  It got really bad  his sleep cycle was completely screwed up  he couldn t even make himself wake up  eating one meal a day  losing appetite etc  It was only luck his family was overseas during that week and he didn t have to face more shit  I thought it would be the week for him to get back on his feet and recover  He said he just wants to cuddle everyday  to be able to hold me and feel truly home and safe  So I did just that  I went over everyday and cuddled him  I pushed aside my studying plans because his mental state right now is more important than a non final exam  I can sleep all day if I want to so basically if i slept in the morning with him because his sleep schedule hasn t been adjusted back yet  I will continue sleeping at night when my body clock hits the same time I used to sleep every day  I can t idealistically stay up and power through just because I slept extra  Of course  I could have studied while he was asleep but I was asleep too and I am not as disciplined as I should  it just wasn t the conducive environment I hoped for before the holidays  After about   days  I was losing steam and getting impatient and stressed over the fact I m completely unprepared  But he managed to get up and sleep during human hours and we had a great day together  Then the next day  I got to his house  managed to get him awake and to shower so we can go out and eat then study but he fell asleep again  I tried getting him up to no avail and I got so frustrated I just left  He was so angry and disappointed and sad because turns out he was actually crying and being sad because of his biggest trade loss  We just started fighting on text and he said he just wanted me to try a bit more  a bit harder  just like how he always did for me  He said he has no other future if this fails and he chose this career partly because of me  how he sacrificed a normal career for me  how he ditched his friends for me because he wants to fully dedicate to me  which I said plenty a times that its okay if he goes to his friends and make more friends I don t mind spending less time if he s happier  but it was his choice  he preferred to spend time with me  He said if he fucks up  his future is gone whereas mine is so bright and I can just study again and stuff  he has no one else to turn to other than me  But my parents don t even know about him  they would be devastated if I screwed up the biggest life determining exam of my life  even more so over a guy they aren t aware of   They don t support dating before my major exam  I told him I m too young to carry his baggage  for him to base his whole life on me  just do what he wants  I m not as noble as him  I can t sacrifice for him all the way like he did for me and at this rate I really am going to screw up my major exams  Secretly  deep down  I was thinking that if he s struggling why does he want me to throw away everything for him just for me to struggle too  Anyway  the fight just ended with both of us devastated but we both spoke our minds and he admitted his choices were not wholly for me  I just focused on studying last minute more and he told me less of his troubles so I could concentrate  which he later says is sacrificing for me  I don t see it that way  I don t think him not seeking consolation from me is a sacrifice on his part  he s not doing something extra for me  I do acknowledge as partners  we are supposed to provide emotional support for each other but I just needed a few days to just study       Fast forward to this week  my exams just ended  obviously I didn t do well and I m not sure if i can pass all my subjects  Today  he just lost a ton of money again because he didn t follow his initial prediction and Brexit was causing the market to be volatile so he wavered and switched sides and lost money  He said he can t deal with this anymore  with his mom s bullshit and my A levels bullshit  I told him I don t know how to avoid inevitable issues that comes with the exam and he said to not use him as a punching bag  not to throw tantrums when he already is so down  how am I not coping when I am so much more privileged than him and of course I can t succeed if I don t put in my       which is true because I am just not disciplined  He said he was already sacrificing for me  But I felt so attacked  I pointed out he wasn t sacrificing  He said he s attacking me just like how I did to him but he just kept it to himself this whole time  I wasn t aware but I definitely wouldn t mind if he told me and would try to change  I always vocalise this to him  He got angry I m trying to prove myself right at a time like this  trying to defend myself when he is already so broken  trying to clarify things  It makes sense  he s the one hurting here  he s saying things because he s defeated  I shouldn t have been picking on those  I really don t know how to comfort him  I don t know how to comfort people in general  When presented with an issue  I can only try to think of a solution  I googled and it s said they just want someone to listen to them  but i don t know how to respond even though I am listening very attentively  I can t tell him things will get better because it might not  or let s go somewhere nice tomorrow  because he isn t in the mood  or don t give up because he will say he failed so many times already  I agree I acted selfishly  this wasn t the right time to point out semantics  I understand my exam which isn t the real final deal isn t as important as him and his future right now but it plays an important factor and honestly I m running out of time  I have less than a year for too much to catch up on  I really don t want to mess this up  This is also my future and life  albeit carrying less significant negative impact than his  He also mentioned wanting to end his life a couple times  I feel so guilty typing this out because he already is suffering and I know I am also at fault here though I think some parts are shady on his part but can someone please give me advice on how to comfort him  where exactly I went wrong  how to remedy this  I don t want to break up  I do intend on marrying him in the future even though he is my first boyfriend because of all that we ve been through  Thanks for reading  
97,0,I  M    feel vert strongly attracted to a girl in my friend group  F    but am unsure how to confessSo I ve not been part of this specific friend group for too long but I ve known most of them for a decent amount of time  I ve only met the girl twice  but we met last night and I realised just how much I like her  I m not stupid enough to rush into anything just yet as we don t know each other too well  I m also worried if I asked her out and she said no then it d be awkward and maybe I d become a bit of a joke with my friends  I ve been kinda down recently and I think having a girlfriend would really pick me up a lot  Thoughts 
98,0,Me      Married to wife      with blended family and seeking advice before a possible bad end So my wife and I have been together close to   years now  we both met in our earlier   s and both knew what we wanted from a partner and each other  This made things simple and easy to maintain our relationship  She has   boys    and    and I have three daughters      and     Up until this point in our marriage things have been relatively calm with a few waves here and there   Things started to get rocky when my two youngest daughters started to lash out emotionally and refused to speak to anyone except my mother   My wife and I discipline when necessary  spank when we absolutely have to  and reward when its earned  We seldom break from that and try to keep things as consistent as possible   Recently I have noticed that her son      and my daughter     have been butting heads a lot more lately and each of them cannot be in the same room with one another without either one of them starting a fight or picking on each other   I had noticed that the    year old is relatively rough and more verbally aggressive towards my   year old  she does her best to fend it off and I step in a lot to calm the situation down and protect her from a lot of it   I had a sit down with her last night before my wife got home and asked her what is wrong and used some of the techniques I learned from my therapist to get some answers out of her  When it came down to it she told me that she was afraid of my wife  thought that she was controlling me  the she doesnt think that step mom likes her  and doesnt like the house   This isnt something I would believe my  yr old would make up  but here I am dumbfounded about the whole thing   I talked to my wife about it last night to see what I would get from that  she got defensive really quick and told me that from now on I should just handle everything with my girls and she should be hands off from it    Mind you  she doesnt think her boys are saints by any stretch of the imagination  but I find with them that they tend to think they can rule the house and try to poke at me to see how much they can get away with   to put a little more of this into context my wife spent the last    years raising her sons alone with the help of her mom and dad    years ago her mom passed and her dad was left to help her out  My wife used to work crazy hours and was barely home most of the time  the boys would rely on their grandfather most of the time  and looked to him as a father figure since their own dad walked out of their lives    years ago   on my side my daughters mother left us but does her best to speak to the girls on a regular basis over skype  The girls mental state was great and I would say collected before we met my current wife and her boys  I spent a lot of time with my girls and made time for them after work and on the weekends   I am at the point where I am uncertain how to move forward  but flags are starting to come up that have me wondering if I should cut my loses  seek out a therapist  hell idk at this point   any advice would be appreciated    amp  x   B   Thank you
99,0,I don t know how to deal with my husbands partying  mental health and alcohol issues Firstly  my husband is a  good guy   great dad and runs his own business   but I don t know how to deal with him at the moment   We have a beautiful daughter and he wants to have another baby   We have known each other    years  been together    years and married for     He doesn t drink during the week but  binges  when he s out and can t seem to control himself   I ll start by explaining the most significant incident   Super Bowl  we re not in The US for context  he had the day off to watch the game with his mates   It starts around   am here   He didn t get home until  am and was really weird when he got home  drunk   pacing the house and wouldn t go to bed   The few days he started complaining about some medical issues  tummy pains etc    Had tests  nothing   We have experienced a tonne of stress recently  amp  then a friend of ours died unexpectedly   His symptoms got worse  amp  so bad at one point that he went to the ER  I met him there the next morning  I didn t have a sitter    Everything checked out  but more tests   in the waiting room he started losing it  i was super worried about him harming himself  told me   amp  the doctor he thought the had HIV  thanks Dr  Google     Apparently Super Bowl night he blacked out and woke up in the Main Street of our town   He thinks he could have visited a sex worker   He was being very irrational  amp  I could see he wasn t thinking clearly  or really making any sense   I think his symptoms we actually panic attacks   Nothing could really convince him even if he DID see a sex worker  she d have to be    HIV positive    Have unprotected sex    actually transmit the infection female to male  I didn t focus too much on this at the time and now he thinks he was really delusional as there s no evidence of this actually happening   Anyway  he told me he was depressed  basically all of his life   We talked about it  saw the GP and he agreed to try meds   he also had HIV and other STD tests done  everything negative   The meds seem to be working   He decided he wasn t going to binge drink anymore   It went fine for the first few weeks   But now he s out  at a football game   He said he d be home by   pm    It s nearly  am and he s messaging me  so obviously coherent but my anxiety is insane   I know he s drinking  even if not as much as he used to   but he just gets so swept up in being out   How do I get over all of this and how can I help him realize the impact this is all having on me too    I can t sleep until he gets home  even if it is all innocent     I m obviously wanting to support him through this mental health stuff but I m really over the going out partying  it s not regular  maybe once every    months  so seems  normal   for lots of guys his age  but it is having an impact on our family     I don t know if I m a bit delusional here too  TBH    I don t see a deal breaker working  I don t want to leave him   I don t think he actually saw a sex worker  but who knows     
100,0,I m gross and I don t feel like I m good enough for anyone Hey Reddit  I m about to dump some real  woe is me  shit  a true sob story  so if that sorta thing ain t your bag  I warned you and you can continue doing you  Here we go     I m gonna get right to it  I have a skin condition  I m fat  out of shape  hairy  poor  injury ridden  socially awkward  and have been battling depression and anxiety with a lovely dash of suicidal fantasies for most of my adult life  This lovely combo of traits has left me in a broken mental state    Well  I m lonely and I long for companionship  I used to have friends and lovers but now I feel like such a piece of shit that I ve resigned to my freak show life and I hide in my room most of the time    Now  most of those things I can change  I can get a gym membership again go on a diet I may be full of injuries by I used to be an athlete weightlifter   I could spend some money time to get rid of excess body hair  but I can t change my skin condition  And if you ve never heard of farunculosis or itis  than I m so happy for you    Gross stuff time  Basically  I get large to enormous size boils all over my body  Especially in areas where skin contacts other skin inner thighs  armpits  crotch   This has been something I ve dealt with since childhood  It used to just be one large one every few months but now I m riddled with new ones and the awful scars left by old ones  Its painful  gross  and beyond frustrating    This brings us to the point  I never want to take my clothes off in front of a potential partner and subsequently  I ve cut myself off from any possibility of being in a romantic relationship  And that fucking sucks    When I was younger  it wasn t that bad  I wasn t full of scars and my outbreaks weren t that bad so I actually got to experience normal relationships and sex  but now I shiver at the thought of someone seeing me naked and being grossed out  Or even worse  seeing them act like they re not turned off by my body  I just know that I miss being intimate and I miss having a girlfriend and being romantic  I miss asking girls out and flirting with the intent of getting a little booty  I miss all that stuff    I m not really sure what advice I need or if this is even the place to bring this to but I ve got no one else  So I ll just close with a question    How do I get from here feel like a p o s   to there feel like less of a p o s     
101,0,Me      M and my boyfriend      M story and what do you think could happen next We met and I was so unsure  He sat there awkwardly and as quiet as a mouse  I just wasn t sure  Being somewhat of an introvert I questioned if there would even be conversation  But for the first time in my life I turned into the conversation starter on the first date  At first it was out of pure desperation because if I didn t we would ve sat there in complete silence  But after the first date he seemed to be genuinely interested  I struggled with whether I would actually meet him again  but I usually do that with every first date  By the third date I finally realized that I was fully interested  At this point he was on my mind occasionally throughout the day  I was excited to meet him for dinners just to see what else I could learn about him  He appeared to be a gentleman  he was interesting  well put together  but what won me over was that he was a good person  That is something I always look for in anyone  I was also attracted to him  I wondered how it would be to kiss him and longed for it             After the second date  he wanted to see me everyday it seemed  This drew me in  I wanted to see him as well but the fact that he felt the need to make sure if it was too much to ask to meet everyday made me feel he was really enjoying my company  How could I say no  But there was a set back it seemed  I would be out of town for two days and I would be across the country from him  We continued to communicate and the entire time I felt as if he was dying to see me again  The feeling was mutual  I just couldn t believe it though  I felt as if everything was on the right page  feelings were already developing and we already had an innocent longing for each other  I wanted to jump up and down as if I hit the jackpot             When I finally returned things heated up as expected  It seemed we were inseparable  I d see him once a day  Meeting in the day turned into meeting at night  Nights turned into sleeping over at each other s places  I felt the connection locking down emotionally and physically  It was almost a full week and I threw out the idea of going on a weekend trip  By Saturday morning we were heading up freeway holding hands as he steered us toward Chicago  I felt so safe in his hands  The way I would catch him stealing glances at me  The way he gripped my hand  Crazy enough feelings for him were already developed  Even though I felt it was so soon  We spent such loving time together  We laughed  explored and did everything together  On the car ride home I felt safe enough to tell him I was developing feelings for him  It was terrifying telling him  We all as humans fear that moment I think for the fears of rejection  But he simply starred in my eyes and told me he felt the same  I still felt so scared  Was this too soon  We barely knew each other yet it felt we had known each other for months  The feeling of being scared and unsure lifted when he started talking about a future together  We talked about moving in together  We talked about so many things that would solidify a future together  I was over the moon            By the end of the week I was moving all my things to his place  My heart was racing  So many thoughts ran through my head  Is this to fast   Am I making the right decision  But the moment I saw him so excited to see me in the house those thoughts of hesitation melted away  I get it  It was lust  infatuation  need and the list goes on  But I had a man next my side that loved me and wanted to be with me  We spent days going back and forth to work and longing for the time we got to spend together at home  It was bliss        I keep myself closed off and don t open my heart easily because I ve been hurt by others in the past  But in this short span of almost four weeks  he made me feel safe enough to do something I never have before  Not only did he ask me to move in with him  he wanted to meet my family and wanted me to meet his  He opened his life to me  Many of these things I ve dreamt for in a man but since it was so soon it did initially bring up red flags  I would ve never considered any of this with anyone  Bringing someone to meet my parents I would never have considered with anyone else  But since he opened his life to me  made me feel safe  said he loved me  I felt safe enough to overcome my fears and open my heart           I understand we moved fast  Looking back instead of taking baby steps we took leaps  We got to know lots of things about each other and had many laughs  But with these leaps things were missed  Gaps were left in our relationship  I realized these gaps many times and had questioned him about them  Sometimes it was things that I thought were important to communicate that were missing  Most times he would assure me that all was well  Was this the so called  honeymoon faze    Were we skipping and sugar coating over things that would become problems in the future   At the time I didn t think so with the assurance I got from him  I thought in my mind with the way he opened his life to me that if we were to have problems we could talk through them and problem solve          Monday  April    was a long productive day at work  It was one of those days where I put extra effort  Everything was perfect  I had no worries in the world the whole day  Actually I was so ready  like most days  to get home to him  I wanted to go home to the place between four walls where I felt most safe  in his arms  It was simple  Just as I ve longed for in the past  I wanted to feel loved and that s what he gave me everyday when he walked past the front door  But this day didn t go as I had been so accustomed to  He didn t want to cuddle  He surprised me with many hesitations about our relationship  He said he had mixed feelings about us living together for the past four days  He was scared that we had moved to fast  Then a long list of things that he had assured me were no problem before came up  Could we financially afford to live together  Was the drive to far  Had I changed my lifestyle to much for him  As I sat there looking up at him in shock that list grew larger  It grew into things that I had never thought were ever problems  He compared our relationship to negative statistics of people moving in fast  his past divorce  his long time of living alone and his capability of knowing how to love  All of the sudden he questioned whether he knew how to love  My heart sank            After lots of my questions stemming from confusion  feelings of chaos and simply being exhausted from work it seemed he had already had his mind set on one thing  I needed to move out by the weekend  My heart felt dented  So many questions ran threw my head  Why so fast  What did I do  I was shocked trying to process all this information at once  He assured me that he wanted to continue to date and even said that I could always move back in the future  I hesitated that thought because if that was the case then why this sudden decision  Then I asked one of the simplest questions  with an answer that would be the most devastating  I asked him if he loved me  There was no answer  As I sat there on the couch staring straight into his eyes  I felt my whole body crumble apart as if I was a glass sculpture that was shattered    I moved out and I m waiting for him to make a decision on whether he wants to continue romantically  What do you guys think  Is this relationship worth continuing or moving on from

105,0,He seems to me a  second hand  guyI am happy with him  BUT      During our first sex he called me with another name  As it turned out  it was the name of his ex  And   months later I got to know  thanks to facebook  that this was his wife with whom he lived separately and is going to divorce her  he was hiding it from me      By that time I loved him so much that I was ready to accept the fact that he was married  It is hard to think of how many times I asked him to hide from me all that little lovely self made things of his ex which she had left in his appartment     amp  x   B   So by the end of      he got divorced  But somehow I still keep comparing my life with him with his and hers life  For example  I recently found his old pictures with her  We never had such warm and nice pictures  not even kisses on the pictures  And he never saves prints out our pictures  He offered her to marry only     year after the beginning of relations  not even having lived together  And he is with me already since     years and we just live together  But he says  he will marry me if we decide to have kids etc   otherwise it is OK just to live together   But he had married her    amp  x   B   The situation that he was already married seems also not anymore OK to me  Because for him to marry me is just  to marry again   and it wouldn t be as for the first time  Plus I think  it is harder for men to marry for the second time  he says   it will not change anything     am I right  And I keep on having the feeling that he is a  second hand      how can I get rid of this feeling  Is it because I am envious that he asked somebody else to marry but not me   Is that easy for a man to get married for the second time    How can I understand that he loves me     amp  x   B    amp  x   B

111,0,I    F  feel emotionally rejected by my boyfriend    M We both have been dating for   years  At the beginning of our relationship he was very nice  I felt happy with him  we spent a lot of time together and never got bored of each other   Now everything changed  he constantly rejects me emotionally  like he always changes topic when I start talking about my problems or not only problems but about things I like either  He mostly talks about himself and doesn t let me talk about myself  He doesn t want to help with anything at all  he always complains when he has to help me with anything  He never cleans anything after himself  He doesn t even work either so his parents support him financially   He always pays during dates or any other activity we do together  he is very physically affectionate  always encourages me to try new things    amp  x   B   And beside all of that he doesn t want to help his parents either  so his parents has to constantly nag him in case to get his help   I tried breaking up with him multiple times but he never lets me go  he always begs me for another chance  when I block him on everything he then appears in front of my door at my house and begs for another chance  He is not manipulative when we are together but when we break up his seems to be  He says he loves me and can t let me go   tldr  so how to get a strength to ignore him completely when he begs me for another chance   I don t see any point to stay in this relationship since it gets only worse not better 
112,0,My    F  mother in law    F  left me a   star review on my business page and now nobody will hire meI started a resume writing  proofreading  and editing service on a website called Thumbtack on Monday  literally five days ago  Since I had helped her with a resume in the past as well as a speech for a volunteer group  I thought it would be morally and ethically sound to ask her to leave a review on my page to help me look more reliable     It was only the second review I had gotten  and she left me a   star review out of    The first review was a   star  and now my rating is a     and that simply isn t good enough for something as serious as resume writing      Since she left me that review  nobody has wanted to hire me to do their projects  and I truly think it s because of her review  When I asked her why she left a   star review  she said  because it makes it look more real   even though I did actual work for her and her review didn t indicate anything negative that would have caused less than   stars   She said   sorry  lol  when I told her I had expected   stars and now I m afraid this business is tanked after just a week     For reference  I had four jobs prior to her review  two of whom are completed  and I am waiting for them to leave reviews but they are older people and not the best with computers  The third job is still in process and the fourth starts Monday  This was a pretty decent start and gave me a lot of confidence  especially since I know that I do good work and with a quick turnaround time for reasonable prices      Am I overreacting  or am I justifiably annoyed  I ve never started my own business before  but I had a solid beginning and now suddenly nobody is interested 
113,0,Confused on what my next step should be  sorry for the long read I m just confused on what to do tbh  The break up I had with my ex happened   months ago and I ve mostly moved on from it  but there s just these reoccurring thoughts that I keep having   There are times where I just want to meet with my ex and see if we can get back together  show her that I changed   How should I contact her  What should I say  Should I even do this   My relationship lasted for     months  So here s the background  I met my ex in class in university at the beginning of the year  We met  talked and became friends for   months before we started dating   When I started dating her  it was different from my previous relationships because I actually cared about this one  I genuinely loved her and she felt the same way  based on what she told me    We were very intimate and honest with each other    It only kept getting better and better  but at the time I felt isolated and lonely  That s because I m new to the city where my uni is at and it was my first time living outside my family   We would be together for most of the week  and she would often sleep at my place   It all went very well until the stress of work  isolation and homesickness got to me one day  I started having a meltdown  After that I started to have some dark thoughts  believing that I should be alone and get used to being alone  So I called my ex and told her we should break up while I was still high on my emotions   It wasn t until the next day  when the fog of emotions finally cleared in my head  that I realized what I ve done    I tried to explain to her in person but I kept choking on my tears everytime I tried   She then told me to not contact her for a month  At the time I was so emotional that I didn t realize that she just needed a break for us to think things through  I didn t see it that way   I texted her what happened and begged her to come back for   weeks  basically acting like an alcoholic deprived of his beer   Most times she didn t answer but then she agreed to meet and talk which  you can guess  didn t go very well   I thought that if we were truly in love that she would ve understood what I went through and give me a second chance  I was ready to change whatever I was doing wrong   At the end she told me to go away and to forget about her  and I ve never felt so heartbroken and helpless   For a week I dedicated myself to self improvement  I worked out more  went outside more  read more and volunteered more  I made new friends that I occasionally hang out with  I saw that I was improving and decided at the end of the week to text her asking her to give me a chance and that whatever problems I had I m dealing with it now   No answer  The silence hurt so much that I started crying on the spot   The next weekend I started to freak out because I started to feel like her other ex  who physically abused her and sometimes texts her   I felt that I was being just as obsessive as him   So I suddendly started texting her long paragraphs telling her I had enough  telling her how I felt horrible  how her treatment basically made me feel like I was being her ex  that I can show her how much I ve changed and improved  She answers back saying I m nothing like him but that she can t talk or meet me   I started crying again and freaking out   The next day  I decided that I had to move on  I held on to much on that false hope that we would be together again that it hurt me mentally   After hanging with some friends  I sent her a text saying that I was gonna give her stuff back  they were still in my room  at uni residence the next day and said she won t hear from me again   Then she replied to not do that  she said that her and her best friend were coming to my place to pick it up   I suddenly overflowed with hope because why would she go through all the trouble of coming to my place when I could just hand it to her directly in uni  I thought maybe she s ging to hear me out  maybe I have another shot   Damn I was wrong on so many levels   I literally waited for her at my place  even skipping my martial arts class that started taking just in case she was gonna show up   Then she called my phone  but when I answered it was her best friend  asking when I m gonna come pick them up    Keep in mind that she said they were gonna come to my place   I suddendly bolted out of the house and towards the train station where they were  I smiled and asked my ex how she was doing  she gave a very short answer and did not even look at me   She then coldly asked where her stuff is and I started to be confused   I just told her that I left it in my room and she asked why   At that point I was trying to hold back my anger so I didn t answer  She then said  it s alright  we were going in the neighborhood anyways    So we walked to my place  me being a few paces ahead of them  She just talked to her friend the whole way  and what hurt me the most is that she was just talking to her in order to distract herself from facing me   When we got home  I went to my room with my wet boots still on  took her stuff  gave them to her and told her to fuck off   After that day  I cut all contact with her and never spoke to her since   It took me a month but I finally moved on  but I realized how much I screwed up  If I just listened to her  we probably would have had a chance but I ruined it   I acted shamefully and needy like  I know what I did wrong and I m improving but I just wish she could see that
114,0,Am I    f  being manipulated by my boyfriend    m  TLDR  my boyfriend blows up at me because he thinks I m either debating him or rude to him  Is he right or is he playing mind games with me    We ve been together for over two years  We live together  Recently we ve been getting into a lot of petty arguments that get blown out of proportion  He has a short temper and loses it when we are just having a normal conversation and then blames it on me for being negative or rude to him    Example    We will be discussing a topic of some sort  and we likely have similar opinions on these topics  but I will bring up another opinion  of mine or idea that may not align with his views  I don t do this to be negative or  debate him  which he thinks I m doing    I genuinely like to discuss multiple points of views on topics  especially political or spiritual ones   I like to have deep conversations about things  Anyway  he will lose his temper and raise his voice and get extremely upset at what I said  I always try my best not to fuel the fire and I try to let him calm down  He will replay the conversation to me about what I said and how I said it   which is usually incorrect  and tells me I always put blame on him for getting into these fights    I try to be careful about what I say and a lot of times I just end up getting really confused about what happened and what he s talking about    Example    more specific   We were driving in separate cars  He was towing a trailer and my friend and I were following behind him to our destination for the night  We get off the highway and he s going the wrong way to the hotel so I call him and tell him  I asked if we should get in front of him  He got so mad for literally no reason and said some rude things to my friend and I  He finally agreed to follow us but then he went the other way and made up this excuse about the trailer not turning and that we ditched him  He made a scene and it was really embarrassing         He will ALWAYS end up apologizing after he cools down but sometimes this all really upsets me   He always says it s not completely his fault too  But I feel like it is    I don t know if I m in the wrong and subconsciously purposely triggering him by things I say  Or if this is him playing mind games with me  Sometimes he makes me feel like I m being manipulative and I m not sure what to think anymore    As a result of these issues and some other personal reasons  our intimacy has been suffering and I don t know what to do  
115,0,I    F  Fell in love with my exs   M  EX bestfriend   M Hi everyone   Im not really sure where to start with this one but ill give a little back story  So  all through out high school I had a really good friend  lets call him Jack    Me and Jack met when I was in  th grade and he was in   th  We just got along really well and always made each other laugh  we d skip class together  and planned on going to prom together even though neither of us actually ended up attending prom  and we remained close friends after high school    After high school is when he introduced me to his old best friend  whom he was best friends with in middle school but they some what had a falling out  Lets call him peter    Peter and I started seeing each other pretty often  and things became serious  however I never fell in love with him despite being together on and off for   years    I found out Peter cheated on me so I left him for good and talked to Jack about it  I had an apartment of my own at this time and Jack began to come over more and more    There was clearly a connection growing between us at this point and I began feeling things that I have never felt about anybody    Things got more flirty  Jack would frequently tell me how he loves me and how beautiful I am  We d hold hands  embrace  cuddle  but never anything beyond this    Then suddenly Jack stopped talking to me  I was devestated and confused and after about a month of not speaking I texted him to confront him about it and he just got really angry and told me he didnt  ghost  me and very sarcastically replied  im sorry im not the friend you deserve       This was about a year ago and though we are cordial now Ill say hi if i see him and we ll like each others posts on facebook etc  but I still think about him every day and I dont know how to get over it    I miss the connection more than anything  but he seems happy with his other friends and I dont believe hes even dated anyone since he stopped talking to me  I dont know how you can do that  especially after     years of  friendship    So people of reddit  what I am basically asking is  How do I move on from this  Is there such thing as  closure  and could have never getting that made this so much harder 
116,0,My    f  long distance  ex boyfriend   m  of   years got half way through breaking up with me through text and stopped answering      Me and my boyfriend have had a rough road these past     weeks and it was very sudden  My boyfriend randomly brought up the idea of an open relationship to me about   weeks ago  He asked what my opinion of it was and I said no way I would be able to do that and he said he prefers closed relationships too  Then  he started hanging out with one of his friends that is a girl late at night and drunk and even had a sleep over with her and clearly I got mad  Then a few days later right before our spring breaks  when we would ve spent    days home together  my boyfriend randomly said that we need to take a break for a few weeks and I seriously needed to consider this open relationship business if we wanted to stay together  He told me that his friends and father all think that we are holding each other back from getting new experiences or whatever that means but literally the only experiences he can t have with other people while dating me are sexual ones         Over spring break we talked   times in person and the second time went especially well I thought and we left off on a decently good note right before spring break was going to end  We decided to continue the break until the beginning middle of April and decide where to go from there  The rules of the break were that we can t hook up with other people and that we weren t going to talk  We got back to school on Sunday    days ago  and this week he ended up sleeping over that same girls room every night since we have gotten back  Me and my boyfriend have an app where we can see each other s locations so I saw through there  This made me so sick  nervous and sad that I literally threw up yesterday morning        After that  I said that I ve had enough of this and I broke the no contact  I basically told him that we needed to talk because I have a huge test week in school next week and I need to focus this weekend  Then he told me he wants to be single because he thinks it s the right thing for him right now  I asked if I did anything or met anyone and he said no  I told him that it makes me really upset that he is doing it over text this way because we will not get any closure and he said that he didn t see any other way to do it  I asked him why he just didn t do it over break then and that maybe we should talk on the phone and he said he didn t do it over break because he wasn t planning on this happening  even though break was literally   days ago   I said well if u weren t planning on it how can you decide this in   days after   years together and then I said that I wanted to talk it out with him so that if this is really what he wants I can move on  He still hasn t answered since last night  he is being such a dick and I don t know why  I need closure to this situation and I want to at least talk to him on the phone  He hasn t answered since     last night because he slept over that fucking girls room again so he was probably too busy fucking her to answer me  I am beyond enraged that he would break up with me over text after our   year relationship like I mean nothing to him  Its sad that I care about him so much and he doesn t even have the decency to call or even answer my texts  I don t know what to do    What should be my next step  I m really tempted to send him a nasty text but I also want closure so I don t want him to get annoyed  Should I politely ask him to please call me or something  should I wait longer  or should I let my feelings out to tell him how much of a dick he is 
117,0,Update  I    M  caught my wife    F  cheating tonight original post   https   www reddit com r relationship advice comments b fubx i   m caught my wife   f cheating tonight    Thanks for all of the advice  it s all been taken into consideration  For now we re going to work through this together  We ve decided that a polyamorus relationship is the best way to move forward  There will be no reason to lie or hide anything and it gives us room to grow and experience the things that I feel we may have missed out on  If either of us develops strong feelings for someone else  we ll openly discuss it and move from there  
118,0,I    M  need help in bed with my  submissive  partner    F  First I d like to note that this is probably a     thread  as I am looking for advice strictly in the bedroom    We have been hooking up for about two weeks and tbh I don t even think I ve made her cum  She has told me many times that she is the submissive type  but really all that means to me is that I should be taking the lead  That sounds great and all but to what extent does that entail  We are past the point of verbally asking for consent when it comes time to hook up so I am free to do just about anything to her   but I have no idea WHAT to do  The one thing I have noticed is that she enjoys being choked way more than anyone I ve ever been with   but outside of wrapping my hand around her throat until she spits up a little I m at     a loss at really what she likes   and whenever I ask what she likes she comes back with the same thing    I just like being submissive   ANOTHER THING and this seriously keeps me up at night  When I go down on her she let s me for like   ish seconds before I feel her hands pulling me hair up towards her face  Im not extremely experienced  but every other girl I ve been with I can drive them crazy with just my mouth  With her other than some light moaning she doesn t appear to like what I m doing down there       I m     and she is      so some positions are a little awkward   but I hope I can get some advice on how to be more dominant 
119,0,My     F  boyfriend     M  acts like a child throws tantrums when he s bad at something I ve been dating my boyfriend for almost a year and things are going really well  I love him and can see a future with him and everything else is fantastic except that he can t control himself if he thinks he s bad at something   Keep in mind that he s never been aggressive towards me in any way  has never taken anything out on me  etc    Here s what I m concerned about  Whenever we play a game  bowling  video games  ping ping  pool  the list goes on anything that can be deemed  competitive    my boyfriend throws a tantrum  What I mean by tantrum is that he ll throw things  for example  the video game controller   fling himself across the room  and on one occasion he almost started crying in public after losing a game  He s done this when it s just the two of us  when we re in public  and when we re with a group of friends   I ve talked to him about it  During tantrums I ll try to calm him down by saying things like  It s okay  I m not judging you  We re just here to have fun  See how bad I am  too   And I ve even talked to him after  saying  I wish you wouldn t get mad like that  It makes me feel sad and uncomfortable   He ll apologize and say that he s just competitive and that losing being bad at something makes him feel like a failure in life  He almost makes it seem like yes  he s sorry about it  but that s just the way he s always going to be   My question is  How do I stop this from happening  I get so embarrassed when he acts like a man child  I don t see myself breaking up with him over it  but it s something that s always in the back of my mind and makes me not want to play games with him because I know it ll end badly  Is there something I can say to him that will make him think seriously about how this is affecting me   TL DR My adult boyfriend throws tantrums  even in public  when he s bad at a game  bowling  pool  ping pong  video games  etc   and it s embarrassing me

123,0,I    m  ate an edible and I want to to share this experience with my wife    f   I believe it will bring us closer to each other  Should I convince her We don t smoke drink alcohol or whatever due to religious reasons  We also have a child and both work full time  I have experimented with an edible  cannabis  last week  and what I found out as an epiphany is that everything in our lives is going so quick but we live past what really matters  We need to take more time for myself and my wife  During the effects of the edible the sex was great  We were at it for     hours  felt like half hour to me  and she said it was great as well  But she didn t know I was high   So last night  again I took an edible and was chilling netflixing etc  But it made me realize I want to hang out with my wife  That really got to me as I don t  do  things with her  I ve been feeling lately as if we only live to work  Coming home  Even then there is work to be done in regards to housekeeping     What I want is just spending a weekend with my wife  to just relax chill eat sex watch netflix  We ll drop our kid off at my parents and just the two of us  But maybe I want this because the effects haven t really worn off  but I believe that being under the influence of the edible will enhance our experience if we take time for ourselves   You may ask if we really need edibles to take a moment for ourselves  It may be the high still speaking but I would argue yes  I believe to be truly ourselves  we need to be put in another state of mind   It may be that my brain is I trying to justify getting high  But I believe it can help us getting closer and to truly take a moment for ourselves  What do you guys think

Growing up  I hated the way I look  hated my body  I hated my life  I have no talent  I have no skill  I m useless  I lived most of my life being insecure of myself  My parents   way of encouraging  is to compare me to every other kid  but tbh they just remind me of how worthless and untalented    Nicole and I met four years ago    M    F   She was my first love  I never knew someone  that I find attractive  would be attracted to me  I ve always hated how I looked while I loved every bit of her skin  I spoke lowly of myself  I warned her of how I m a useless piece of shit and how she should not waste her time with a lowly loser like me   That s how low my self esteem was   She ignored my pleas and never gave up on me   Nicole loved me as much as I loved her and she took care of me as I took care of her  She made me feel like I matter  Nicole and I were in love   Everything was going great  We never missed a day without seeing each other  We kept telling each other of how our day went and how life sucks and how stress from school just disappears when we re together  Nicole was awesome  She became my bestest friend   Fast forward two years later  the spark between us    M    F  began to disappear  While that didn t sever our relationship  since we had proven to be each other s best friend   it was at this point where my insecurities started affecting our relationship  Arguments happen more frequently  and there were days where we wouldn t talk to each other   One time she snapped and mentioned how I should start fixing myself and how she is getting sick of taking care of a baby that s two years older than her   She was right   Instead of working on my insecurities  I started hating myself even more  I realized how much of a piece of shit I was so I kept saying sorry for being like this  Whenever we fight  I would blame myself and apologize  This continued on for   years I guess   Nicole    F  got tired of me    M  no doubt  Afterall  who wouldn t  We got into a really bad fight one day and she shouted that she s sick of feeling like she had to take care of a fucking baby  She attacked my insecurities  I just kept apologizing and blamed myself for it   She broke up with me  early June        She has already grown tired of me  but I don t blame her  It really was my fault   I was back to being depressed and hating myself even more    I just deleted a shit ton  five  of paragraphs  They were just about how depressed I was and how I attempted suicide on my birthday    Anyway  months after missing her  I started to pick myself up  I realized that if I wanted to win her back  I need to shape up  And  well  after a week or so  she sent me this    November            heyyyy insecure since birth  i think it s best you hear it from me  i think i might have found someone  i m sorry   i didnt know how to break it to you bc i know it s gonna hurt real bad  but i think it s better than not telling you at all      long message   Nicole  Everything just went silent after reading it  I immediately went home and cried myself to sleep  I just slept  slept  and slept  hoping it was just one big nightmare   It s like nothing mattered anymore   I don t remember much what happened after that  I was just depressed  I didn t eat much  Daily routine was just going to class then going home then sleep  I blamed myself and was punishing myself  Time after that felt like one big nightmare that I couldn t get myself out of   Every now and then  I would miss her and I would check Nicole s Instagram and Twitter  she s most active on those two platforms  and I could tell how much happier she is with this new guy  Seeing her happy with him just kills me   At one point  she tweeted how her sister wished that I was still Nicole s boyfriend    just so she  Nicole s sister  could have her current boyfriend   It s the end of March now  I started writing this in the middle of March  and I really do feel that I have to get myself out of this shithole  but I don t know what to do anymore  I don t know how to get out of this mess  I dug my hole too deep for me to get out   For people who experienced going out of a long relationship  what do I do   I m sorry if r relationship advice is the wrong sub to post this  I just need help 
125,0,How do I    F  help my boyfriend    M  with his struggling anxiety and emotion slumps even though we are currently arguing Hi all  I ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for over   years and we ve lived together pretty much all of that time in the US   We began dating when I was    and he was    so we were young and having fun for the first part of our relationship  As we got older  we graduated and had to put on our big boy and girl pants and find jobs  move out  etc    I preface with this because we both had a lot of maturing to do while also trying to be good  decent SOs to each other  I guess that s normal for couples in their early   s as they continue moving into their relationship  With that being said  we haven t been perfect or always great to each other  For the most part it s great but there are times when we argue like the world is ending because we aren t communicating appropriately or we let our emotions run wild  We ve gotten better but it s always a learning process   Anyway  we got into an argument a few days ago about how I m tired of cleaning up after him like a toddler  age old argument right   and it happens to be around the same time he s really struggling with work and what he wants to do in life  He works from home and is either not given work for days  even though he s salaried  or assigned    tasks that are honestly way above his pay grade  It s really frustrating him and i can see it s bringing him down  but he also has been giving me a hard time about petty stuff in our relationship  which is pushing me away and not making me want to help him feel better or be there for him  He s asked me for help and just to be there but I am having a hard time being emotionally available  I know it s a dick move on my part  but I m trying to justify his behavior with the fact he s really sad and drained from work  We re all human  right    So I ask you  Reddit  what can I do  Even though I m so drained from the arguments the past few days and it pushes me away from him  I think the appropriate thing to do in a partnership is to help him feel better as he goes through this slump self struggle panic attacks but I literally don t know how 
126,0,My GF has an internet friend of    years We were watching football together today and I saw some pretty massive paragraphs on her phone and said  who s that   She said he s a friend I ll explain after the game  Turns out it s an internet friend of    years and has caused problems in her previous relationships    I m feeling weird because she was quite defensive about it despite assuring me she was with me  My major fault in this was suggesting that he likely has feelings for her and questioning why she said her previous partners were worried she had more of an intellectual connection with him than then    This has turned in to a bit of an argument and I do trust her but it was mostly her reaction that made me feel a bit off    Any advise  
127,0,friendship with best friend    f  is slowly falling apart and i    f  dont know what to doHi  This is going to be a bit long  so thank you in advance to those who read it  Also  english is not my primary language  so I also apologize for mistakes in advance    I have around   best friends  and the one I have started to get problems with is a girl I got to know through college  This was a year ago  and we grew very close  She became one of my best friends  and I think the feeling was mutual   Then she met two other girls that study the same as we do and kind of formed a group  I of course didn t know them as well as she did  and now we nearly did everything together as a group  Don t get me wrong  I really liked them and I was trying to get to know them better  This also went well for a while  until one month ago or so from now  everything changed   My best friend  let s name her A  kind of started to make everything about her  She talks a lot  that s a character trait of hers  But the problem now was that it was really difficult for me to join in on the conversation because she started to ignore my inputs to the topic and just brushed over me  also kind of raising her voice  And when I wanted to start a conversation  she swooped in and began a completely new one    A always came to the lectures half an hour earlier and the other girls came   minutes earlier than me  And when I arrived  A had them already engaged in a conversation in which i couldn t join  The common thing that would happen was that she had told them a story that happened to her  to which i only knew the beginning  because she used to tell me everything   She told them the ending of the story and asked about their opinion and when I asked about what it was that they were talking  she always pushed me aside with a  i ll tell you later  and continued to talk to the other girls  So i became silent  it really hurt me a lot because I didn t know why she was all of the sudden behaving like this    This went on for about two weeks  then a major event developed which hurt me a lot  We went to eat together with one of the two friends  so we were   people  I tried to start a conversation with A  but she completely ignored me this time  She only talked to the other girl  And when i tried to start a conversation or include myself in the conversation  i could feel that she was getting pissed off  So i texted her if everything was okay  She was kind of on her phone so she saw the text  but ignored it  She instead told her friend about this new vegan restaurant that she really wanted to try with her  only with her  She made that very clear  That made me upset because I think its rude to make plans in front of someone s face when that person isn t included  You can make those plans when you re both alone  So when the other girl went to the bathroom i confronted her  asked if there really wasn t something wrong  but again she said no and took up her phone and continued to ignore me  Wtf  So i stayed silent because at that point i was pretty upset and also hurt    The plan was to go shopping together when we finished eating but she was treating me so badly that i decided to say that i was feeling sick and went home    She didn t change after that incident and i didn t ask her anymore about it because i thought she would apologize herself  but she did as nothing has changed   You see  when we re alone together  she is completely normal  just like when we were good friends  But when the other   girls are around  she becomes this monster to me  I don t get it    So last thursday  I called her out for it  I asked her why she was doing that and behaving this way in form of a voice message  She answered me with a really long voice message in which she said she didn t get my point  because it was my fault that i was being left out because i didn t make enough effords to include myself in the group  I told her this wasn t true and that she was making it very hard  but that wasn t even the main problem  I don t care if i don t fit right in into the group  i just don t want to feel like shit when I m around her  SO i ask her why she treated me bad that time at lunch and all those other things  She then answered with a long text that she didn t do those things and that I was being rude to HER those past weeks    This threw me completely off  When had I been rude to her  So i asked her that  and my voice messages were always calm  and she simply texted me back  honestly  i don t want to talk to you becaue i don t have the energy for it  lets talk another day about this     She never texted me since that answer  I texted her on wednesday if she would have time to talk at the college campus on thursday and she simply said that she wasn t going to the classes on thursday  She didn t suggest any other dates or anything  In the group chat with the other girls she happily engages    I don t understand any of this  She used to tell me how i was not going to get rid of her because i know so much about her and she likes me so much and she was sooo happy to have get to know me and now she did this complete character turn  Because i critiziced her actions  Am i not allowed to do that    She also always used to say how she was the confrontational kind and she hates the games women play when they re mad with each other  but now she is ignoring all my snap and instagram stories and not texting anything and not wanting to sort this out with me    I really don t know what to do now  Should I be the one to suggest another date to meet up and talk  The thing is that I nearly don t want to do that anymore because I feel unwanted now  I feel like she doesn t need and want me anymore and I still do and it upsets me  I feel betrayed    I feel like if i don t text anything anymore then we will just  ghost  each other and never hear anything from each other again  But i ll probably see her in collage which will be awkward so i really am lost here and don t know what to do    Thank you for reading all of this 
128,0,Me    F  and my boyfriend    M    Wandering  eyesHello people of Reddit   So the other day  my boyfriend and I had talked about   wandering   eyes  Yes  I understand the whole idea that  just because you re in a relationship does not mean other people are   NOT   attractive  My problem with him was that the girls he looks at  likes photos of  follow on social media are very raunchy  sexual and lewd  I asked him   Would you like it if I were to be like that   He said no  His reason was because I am exclusively for him  but if I were to do it he wouldn t be too happy but will try to accept it because he loves me  He told me they re just objects and it s just lust  He told me that because we have a personal connection  it wouldn t make him happy if I showed off my body like those girls  He won t progress forward with anything with these girls because they don t have a connection   He brought up that I have celebrity crushes who I fangirl over  I feel that it s different because these people are unobtainable  I don t mind if it were celebrities that he looked at  but the girls he look at are in the same playing field as I am   EDIT  It s a long distance relationship  he s on deployment right now  I feel that  you shouldn t feed into behaviors that you do not approve of   but he says it s harmless  Am I wrong  Is it something to be worried about  Have you guys or girls experienced anything like this  How would you deal with this   I am open to all opinions and comments  I really want to know how to deal with this    amp  x   B   Thanks
129,0,My girlfriend wants to become veganMy girlfriend and I are good together and I love her tremendously  She told me she is going to switch to a vegan diet  I expressed that I dont agree with her decision but I ll try to support her  However  she said that she feels as if I dont love her for who she is  How do approach this in a way that will end in peace 
130,0,My    f  boyfriend    m  has said he would take a job with a very good salary and leave me to relocate if given the opportunity and I don t know how to react Me and my partner have been together for   months and we live together  We moved in after   months because we wanted to be together and we were both living at our parents house at the time   We have a lot of discussions regarding careers because we are both very ambitious   A casual conversation about me turned into a heated one with him saying if a job with a very decent salary came up but meant he would relocate and I wouldn t couldn t come he would still take it   I feel that this means money and career are more important than me to him and our future  which we have talked about   Am I selfish to think that way   He thinks it would be wrong to choose a relationship over such an opportunity   Is this something to be concerned about long term   He does say that he is unlikely to ever want to relocate because he loves where we live  but I m worried that building a relationship  and potential family and future in this state would be risky   Any advice    TLDR  Partner is saying a job opportunity is worth leaving a relationship if salary is especially high  Am I right to be worried about building a relationship in this situation   
131,0,My friend s  early   s  mom    s   is trying to kill herself by not eating or taking medicationApologies in advance for any errors  as I m typing this at work   Also not sure if this is the proper sub  but I m not sure where else I could ask for help   The title pretty much sums it up   He came in this morning and when I asked him how his day is going he said  honestly man  I m pretty depressed   My mom won t take her medicine and I m really worried about her    I asked further and he opened up a bit more and said that she hasn t eaten properly in weeks and doesn t even weigh    lbs anymore  and is refusing to take pain medication   So she is malnourished and in intense pain        He said that he and his father are pretty sure she wants to die and they have no idea what to do   Reddit  I m at a loss for what to say to the guy   I m thinking there s gotta be somebody they can call to maybe get her hospitalized  but I honestly don t know   Does anybody know what he should do 
132,0,HELP  I NEED YOUR HONEST ADVICE    Ok guys  my second post here  Really impressed with the speed of the first response so here goes question     It might sound really stupid to some people  but I need some advice about my boyfriend    He s pretty perfect  he s funny and really handsome  I really thought he was ticking all the boxes until recently  we ve been together for   months   we tell each other we love each other and all the rest and by the looks of his face  he s super genuine   From the very beginning I noticed he was awful with time keeping  he d be hours late or cancel all together  Normally people running late doesn t really bother be that much if I know it isn t intentional but now after yesterday  I don t know how to feel   On Wednesday during the day  he told me that he didn t finish work until   pm but was gonna be bored after  So I offered him to come sleep over at my house after work and he said he d think about  he had loads to do and didn t know what time he was getting out  He ended up messaging me a little after that and said he wasn t gonna come  he was too tired and was just gonna go home    I take him at his word and say good night  we had already planned to see the next day  Thursday  instead so I wasn t that bothered  I took him at this word about being tired    Then Thursday comes around  he finishes work at  pm  he was meeting a friend at  pm for some quick food then was meeting me for about  pm  Everything planned  I was happy  he was happy  happy days    So  pm comes  he s still there   pm comes  he still there    pm comes apparently he need to go to the shops for supplies and tells me to meet him at his for        a whole   hours after he was meant to be meeting me   So I meet him at his and we re chatting away  he s telling me about the friend he had just eaten with  He then drops the bomb shell that he had went for food with that friend on the Wednesday night too  I seen something drop in his face as he thought he had dropped himself in it  I let it slip and didn t approach him about it but this morning  after checking all my messages from around that time from him  if he was with his friend again on the Wednesday when he said he was working and was too tired  why did he lie to me about being at work    He has told me in the past that he has told little white lies about where he is  normally if he just wants alone time and is in bed  he ll say he s going to sleep    minutes before he actually does     which I m grand with  heck I do that     But I feel this is another scale lie  I m not sure  I m trying to be as secure as I can be in my own mind about everything  but he has cheated on   past partner so it s making me think can I trust him  About everything  he had no reason to have to lie about where he was   I don t know why he d feel he has to lie  I d never and have never tried to control what he does  I encourage him to go meet his friends without me  I believe we both need our separate time with our friends     Sorry I know it s long but I d really appreciate some input advice  help    
133,0,My partner says I m the problemThrow away account   long read       My    f  partner    m  of ten years works a full time job of    hours a week or more    depending on the season as he farms  I m a stay at home mom to three kids    and under    I m horribly unhappy in our relationship family life  I feel like I m alone all the time and my partner doesn t contribute anything except his pay check  I have told him this and he tells me I m the problem  and no matter what I m not happy  So I have no idea if I really am the problem or if I have a reason to think he isn t putting his effort into our relationship         Now  because of his work he basically gets to create his own hours and come and go to work as he pleases  Sometimes he will tell me he is at work when in fact he is at a buddies house  or the bar etc  Or he will go straight to a buddies house to drink after work and not tell me what he s doing  I have asked him to call me and let me know what s up and he tells me if I want to know where he is I can call him  There has been days where he is literally only home to sleep  then he s out the door  And if I question him about what he s doing  he will give me a huffy one word answer and be gone  Then days later I will find out from someone else he was at a buddies house or at some event        He goes out to drink multiple times a week usually  the least he goes out in a week is one night at least  Now I understand everyone needs their nights out and time to themselves  but how is it fair I sit at home every night by myself while he has a social life  He tells me that s my fault and not his and that he can t be my friend  Our kids are young and I am their primary care giver   I also have no interest in going out and drinking like he does  and I ve told him this  And I ve told him it s pretty hard for me to have a social life with kids and responsibilities  Everyone tells me I will have my chance when the kids grow up  but why does he get to do whatever he wants while I m the parent and responsible one in this situation        He doesn t lift a finger around the house  which I understand when he isn t home or he is actually working  He s washed the dishes three times in the past seven months  and he will give the kids a bath maybe once every few weeks  That s the extent of his helping  When he is home he usually sits and plays video games or heads outside to do his own things  I have asked him to be more involved around the house  such as maybe cook once a week etc  He tells me he works and doesn t have time  but yet he has time to hang out with his friends whenever he wants   We moved last summer and I did all the packing myself  When I asked him for help organizing and packing he told me he has a real job and I don t  so anything house related is my job alone       He also has tons of hobbies that take time and money such as hunting  quading  snowmobiling  During hunting season I m basically invisible to him and barely see him for three weeks  I understand having a hobby but I feel like he takes it to the extreme  and I ve told him this  Once again he tells me to get my own hobby  What he doesn t realize is that he gets to have all these hobbies and time with friends because I am here taking care of the kids  house etc  And when I bring this up to him it usually results in him yelling in my face to leave and to do my own thing       Getting him to do anything with the kids and I is like pulling teeth  I m the one who takes them to visit his parents  my parents  and any family between us  When the kids and I go do something fun we usually bring my mother in law with  The odd times he does go with us to anything he is cranky and mean and starts a fight or argument  I don t think it s normal that any family outings include his mom and not him  His family and him seem to think this is normal though and I can t seem to get my opinion in or understood      I used to take the kids for a weekend and go visit his family who live over an hour away but I stopped doing this due to the stress of coming home  I would come home to him still in bed at   p m  extremely hung over and puking all day  Our dogs would have no food or water as well   The dogs are my responsibility  and the house would be a disaster even though I left it clean  I put up with coming home to this for four years  but recently I just can t handle coming home to that situation anymore      He will complain about the meals I cook and flat out tell me he s not eating it if it s something he doesn t like  Sometimes I cook things the kids like and he doesn t  because well  kids are picky  He will ask me what I m going to cook for him instead  When he gets home from work he will go straight to his video games and tell me to make him a plate  Which I was doing until recently  the last time he asked me I told him to turn off his game and get his own damn plate  He has never made me a plate  nor would I ask him to  He will tell me to do his laundry  and usually throw in a joke about how I don t do anything      I have also talked to him about getting a job myself over the past few years   I was working when we had two kids  he has told me that if I get a job he won t help any more than he already does  So that would mean I would have a job on top of all the child care  cooking  cleaning  pets etc  This alone has stopped me from getting even a part time job because I already feel like I have a lot on my plate      I feel like I m at a loss  and even though I know I feel fed up  he makes me feel like I m the one who is overreacting  I have no close friends or family to get their opinion on this from  So Reddit I ask  am I the bitch in this situation             
134,0,I don t know how to bring up financial responsibilities as a couple  Can anyone give me some advice I m    and my    year old girlfriend have been together for about   months  She moved in with me and so far I have been the one that MOSTLY works  I pay the rent and the bill  She s had a few jobs that have brought home money  Not nearly enough however  Not because she can t work  she can  We offered her a   hr job a few weeks back but didn t take it because it was a    minute bus ride  Right now she s in the process of working at Home Depot  However rent is due in a few days and we pawned her laptop a few months back to help pay for rent her idea  now we need to pay to vet the laptop back before the  st  So far she has not brought up rent laptop but yesterday told me that when my sister was gonna pay her share of    dollars for the internet  If not she ll change the password  This morning I found out she s spend this past   weeks about    dollars or more on video games and shows  Right now I don t even buy lunch or take the bus to save me money    however she s out here just spending it  Where does this money come from  I gave her my checks so she can save them in her saving account but I m afraid she s using the money to buy for her stuff  I need to bring this up but I m afraid I don t know how because a part of me knows she will leave 
135,0,My gf lied to me but I only know because I went through her phone I had suspicions that my girlfriend of three years was cheating on me based on the way our relationship has been deteriorating recently  and I know it s a huge invasion of privacy  but I confirmed tonight that this was the case based on some texts that I found on her phone  I feel incredibly betrayed but I don t know how to confront her without revealing that I am also an asshole for going through her phone  How should I handle this 
136,0,How do you know which problems in a relationship can be fixed and which problems can t be and you re better off breaking it off     F    M Hi everyone   So I broke up with my boyfriend yesterday  because I realized I needed to do some growing and treating my anxious attachment in relationship  which was causing conflicts  and making both of us feel emotionally drained  He said my anxieties felt  insatiable   which is fair    I want to eventually reach out and involve him back into my life  but not for a really long time  when I feel like I have a better handle on my cognitions behaviors    The problem is  our relationship and friendship had been very passionate and felt like a soul connection  this feels silly to say because I m not someone who typically believes in soulmates  or anything like that   And we did have conflicts separate from my anxiety  I don t either of us realized how much work being in a relationship required  So my question is  how do you know if the issues in a relationship are fixable or if you re better off just breaking it off  I can t tell how much my anxiety contributed to the conflicts  He s a really easygoing guy  although he is most of the time secure  he s not super affectionate  Should I just look for someone who can better handle my anxiety  I m planning to work on it  and seek therapy and meds  better than my ex  Are there better partners suited for me  
137,0,My gf sent nudes to her close friend right after we broke upWe ve been together for about   years and decided to call it off about     days ago  We love each other to the core and called it off on good terms  However  lately she s been protective of her phone which I never went through during our   yrs  I ve always made sure to respect her privacy  This time though I felt something in my gut so I just went through it real quick  I feel like shit  I know we re not together anymore she can do whatever she wants but it hurts when we were crying together just last night  
138,0,Its been a little over a month since me and my girlfreind has had sexMe       and her       have not had sex in a month and a week  and its starting to wreak havoc on my mind  Although to her  it amazingly doesnt bother her  We have been together   months  Last time we had sex it was kinda of akward because i couldnt get it up  because i start to have anxiety and doubts at the beginning of sex and heres why  Ever since we been having sex from the  st day  she goes dry after a while  She says the sex is too long  and that her birth control us main culprit  and that she had the same problem with her ex  So she bought lube  it helped a little  but stil the same result of her getting dry during sex  Plus she takes some sort of anxiety medication  I googled the side effects and unfortuantley  the first side effect that popped up was lack of desire to have sex  Like  how much worse can this get  In the back of my mind  i was thinking could she be having sex with someone else  And i have to say thats hard to say  because we both live together she doesnt act suspicious at all  Basically she hasnt gave me a reason to suspect shes having sex with someone else  the relationship between me and her is quite well  She always kisses on me in a teasing manner  she always tells me she loves me  we do alot of stuff together  all that lubby dovey stuff  Its just i quit initiating sex because i know exactly what will happen  and that is ill be too worried about getting her off first  then shell go dry  and it will just be a session of dissapointment on both ends  My girl purchased some kind of  horny goat pills  to help  and she plans to withdrawl from her birth control  in april to see if the sex improves between us  Its just that on my end its creating all day self esteem wrenching insecurity  i have been overthing thus every single day and im tired of it  i think of things like maybe shes not that attracted to me  All freaking day     things of that nature  We talked about that also  she said that is no where near the case and she holds her story that the culprit is the birth control  and the medication she is taking  I am trying my hardest to wait and see what happens  It just sucks to have to watch porn when i just want to have sex with her  Any suggestions    Tl dr me and girlfreind has not had sex in over a month  and i dont know how much longer i can hold on 
139,0,My    F  friend    F  forgot that I had told her my dad passed away  and I had to tell her all over again  I am quite upset and don t know how to tell her how hurt I am that she could forget something so big and important My    F  dad passed away about two and a half years ago  I cannot begin to convey the depth of my grief over losing him  as he was my best friend and the person who understood me best  I am still processing my grief and working through it  and I get terrified that someone is going to ask me about my collective  parents   because so many people just assume that everyone my age still has both parents   So about two weeks ago  a new friend    F  that I have known since about August         months ago  asked me generally about my parents  I said that my dad passed away and that now it s just my mom  The friend seemed genuinely sad to hear it  But she has a problem where she is really forgetful and will ask the same questions over again  even though she has already asked them  I had a feeling that she might forget that I told her about my dad  but I figured there was no way someone could forget something so big and important    So then last night  I was with this friend and we were talking about families  She said   What about your dad  I never hear about him   My heart sank  She had forgotten  I replied   I thought I had told you  He passed away  Do you not remember   And all she said was   I remember now   But she did not apologize  and did not seem to grasp how hurt I was am that she could forget something like that    I can see us becoming good friends and really want to tread carefully so I don t ruin our friendship  But I also feel that I want to say something to her to express how hurt I was am and to try to get her to acknowledge that  since she did not apologize in the moment    This is never a situation I thought I d be in  so I would love any advice you have about how I can bring this up with her in a kind way  without ruining our friendship or being accusatory  
140,0,What happened  Me   F  and him   M So I matched with this guy on Tinder on Sunday and we started talking that night  He then asked me why I swiped right on his profile and I proceeded to tell him that I thought he was cute  He asked me if I wanted to talk on the phone and I so sure  So he proceeded to call me and we started talking about the basic things  favorite color  favorite food  hobbies  etc  Then our conversation started to heat up and we started talking about our sexual desires  past relationship histories  etc  We stayed on the phone all night and we didn t hang up until Monday morning because I had class and he had to work  We still texted all throughout the day  When I got home from school and work  he would call me and we would do the same thing all over for the next few days  Yesterday night  we were on the phone and he texted me and asked me what I was doing  I told him that I was looking at some problems for my upcoming test and he abruptly ended the call  I sent him a gif with a  really face  and it said sent as a text message  I knew something was wrong because I seen that he had read my previous message because his read was on  So I decided to sleep on it  The next morning I tried to send him  Good Morning  and the message was originally blue but then it turned green and said sent as a text message  He had added me as a friend on facebook the second day we started talking and I could see that he was still sharing posts and posting on his feed  I figured that he probably just blocked me but I want to know why  I want to know what I did wrong  During previous conversations  he would say that I didn t talk to him a lot but I m a quiet person until I get comfortable with you  You could tell that I was starting to get more comfortable with him because I was talking more and more and actually starting conversations  I don t know why but those few days I talked to him  I started to like him  I just want to know why he would block me instead of just telling me that he no longer wanted to talk to me  He told me that he was honest and that communication was important but he went and did this  I m an understanding person so I would not blame him if he didn t want to continue to talk to me  It just bothers me that he up and left without telling me anything or what I did wrong  His feedback could have helped me in future endeavors  I really want to ask him why but he blocked my number so obviously he doesn t want to talk to me  Any idea on what happened and why he did this  
141,0,Insecure about the fact that my gf was  promiscuous  before we metWe re both      been together for    months  and things are really great  We re each other s first  serious  relationship  I know this is probably an irrational concern  but I m aware she was pretty promiscuous before we got together  Shortly after we met  she asked me how many people I had been with  so I asked her  as well  She told me     but I m pretty confident it must be more than that  Not that I care the exact number  although if it was  say  more than     people  I d probably be a bit concerned     She s also very  sex positive   and all that  which I support  as well   The first few months we were together  she d get texts from guys asking she d want to  hang out  again  and we randomly saw someone she had sex with at a store  he said hi to her and it was very apparent what their connection was based on her reaction   Lastly  I know I m not her historical  type   physically  She was the traditional  went after all the jocks kind of girl during most college  Meanwhile  I m small  white  and skinny   I m also kind of concerned that she ll get tired of only being with me  and want to return to being with many different people  like before    Overall  I m just insecure about the fact my gf is much more experienced than me  as well as how I m much different from the guys she hooked up with during college  Although I haven t been open about it  it s definitely picking on me when we aren t together  Any tips   Tl Dr gf was promiscuous during college  she s much more experienced than me  I m also the complete opposite  physically  of the kind of guys she d hook up with  I m pretty insecure about it    not sure what to do

143,0,My wife s extended family is having a collective breakdown and no one knows what to doBeen married to my wife for almost   years  together for    Her family in general has had a series of problems  Her dad s a recovering alcoholic  sister has a rough relationship with her kids father  None of this is has been as trying as whats been happening with her Aunt and cousins though     amp  x   B   Before I met my wife  her aunt and uncle bought a run down house in the middle of Maine with their two young boys  For clarity lets call them Uncle  Aunt  Cousin   and Cousin   Cousin  was probably   when they moved up there  and Cousin  was around      Their move isolated them in a town of maybe     people  and its the type of town where if the locals don t know you  you arent welcome  They ve been battling the outsider title for a long time  Isolating the kids has not been beneficial for them  Uncle wanted to move them away from the craziness of life  but as an alcoholic himself he essentially neglected them and left them to their own devices  This forced them into trying to have a childhood through video games and the internet  They never fit in the local schools  switch schools mid highschool  and have developed awful anti social attitudes  rightfully        Uncles not only an alcoholic  but a  mans man   When someone talks about the toxicity of masculine men theyre talking directly about Uncle  He s brutish  has to put people down to feel big  couldnt go a few hours without mentioning how hard his job is and what morons everyone he knows is  For some reason he liked me because we both play drums and I can dish out sarcastic shit as fast as him       Aunt has always seemed like the normal one  She loved Maine for a time  but couldn t find work and what work she didnt find was full of the locals who hated her for being an outsider  She stopped working and took care of the house  the chickens  and her garden  Every time we talked she seemed like she had the most reasonable perspective       While their family dynamic was unique and seemed easily fractured  no one suspected that anything more than normal family shit was going on  Until     years ago when Uncle and Aunt split up  it was a super ugly divorce  Uncle moved out and would post horribly cringy and depressing shit on FB  Aunt got a restraining order against him because she said he had been abusive  no one was able to corroborate this      amp  x   B   As it continued  Aunt started to lose it  She started saying that people where after her  that Uncle had been part of a drug ring and him and his drug coworkers were breaking into their house  She said that Uncle would prostitute himself out for drugs to the neighbors  and that she was being watched  She ended up moving into a woman s shelter with the kids for a time  Uncle went off the deep end and wounded up totaling his truck in a DUI incident and broke his hip  After this he stopped visiting his family  and eventually moved to a southern state to work for a friend in his industry  Cousin  and Cousin  had to live with my wife s father for a summer for Aunt to get her shit together       Things seemed to calm down for the past year or so until last month  Aunt started calling my wife s father with more conspiracy theories  except their getting so much worse and its taking a huge toll on the kids  She called and said she thinks her mother  my wifes grandmother who is the sweetest old lady  is conspiring with Uncle  for reasons  unknown   Shes changed the locks on her house     times because she thinks people are watching her and break into her house when she leaves  There was a brown paper bag in her street some redneck littered from the liquor store and she thinks its a sign from her stalkers  She s sent letters to the local ME sheriff trying to document theft from her home  and the letters are the rantings of a mad person  She told her father  my wife s grandfather  that Uncle had pimped out Cousin  for drug money when he was a kid  no one s able to corroborate this  or anything she says        Last week  Cousin  had a depressive breakdown at school and was admitted to a mental health facility nearby  When we tried to contact Aunt about what happened  because we only heard about this through the family grapevine   she ignored everyone s phone calls and wouldnt talk to anyone  My wife and I have been talking to Cousin  about whats been going on  but he keeps saying hes afraid to talk about it       We dont know  as a family  how to address any of this  We dont know who to tell about Aunt s increasingly psychotic behavior  we dont know how to report it in a way that doesnt cause further mental harm to the kids  Its to the point where we fear that Aunt or Cousin  will go off the deep end  Where can we start to address this  
144,0,Oceanic Situation  I have a situation i would really like an outsider view on  So i am a college student in a serious relationship with a man we ll call harris  however i also have a toddler with another man we ll call kevin that unfortunately does not stay with us  So to give the back story is Kevin and I were together about   years   I met him when i was    and he was     Being young i thought i found someone who i could grow and build a foundation with and moved in with him and his brother as well as the girlfriend only after   months of talking  things were okay for a while but around   months of us being together we had received a visit from the land lord stating that he was selling the properly and they owner was going to raise the rent  we had discuss the issue with our roommates which indeed tell us that they were staying at the apartments  We agreed and everything was fine   About   weeks later his brother pulls us to the side and says that they leaving the apartments and moving someone else  Now this is a crushing blow to us because we were struggling financially and we both had just started new jobs so we ended up moving in with his mother  This is also around the time i found out i was   weeks pregnant  When we had moved in with his mom we set the expectation that it wasnt going to be forever and that we would pay her     whenever we got money  which was about every other week  however when we started getting food and other necessities she began to act different towards us in a hostile way and we ended up getting kicked out and moving to my sister house for a month  While at my sister house i had received a settlement of money and bought us an apartment he had just got another job after losing the last one and told him that from here on out i would be the one working because he could not hold a job  About   months after getting our first apartment  we had received our bills and broke down because we weren t able to pay them on just my salary at a corner store alone and we ended up moving back to his mother house where we stayed at for   years  During this   years we are consistently arguing over our daughter  money  getting our own place  him getting a job with some sorry excuse of no one being able to watch our daughter and i just got tired of it  At my new job i was a senior advisor technical and this is where i met harris  Harris was a mentor for me that ended up helping me doing some work  i told him thank you and the conversation just kinda went from there and for the first time ever it felt like a fresh air and i wasnt being suffocated between a bum of a baby daddy and his over controlling mother  I gave harris my number and so we began to talk and this went on for about   months  Within those   months with harris felt like he accomplished so much more than what kevin did in every department  He was caring  thoughtful  silly  charming  smart and non controlling nor possessive  He had a job and anything i asked for   i got which was different for me because i was the one paying for everybody else  Anytime i asked for anything regarding my daughter he was quick to jump on it    Then kevin mom ended up kicking us out  again  and we moved in with his sister we ll call brittney  Brittney took us in and we explained it was only gonna be a month  Well over the course of a month Kevin had seen text messages from harris on my phone saying he loved me and that when hell broke loose  That entire day kevin had brutally beaten me to the point i felt like i need to go to a hospital but didnt   everytime i ran on foot from him he would scream at me that our daughter is by herself in the house and i ended up leaving her with him at his sister house and moved in with harris later on that week  When we hsd first moved together in everything was still fresh and was gonna take some time and that when kevin humiliated me on social media and called out harris family as well and it took everything i had to keep harris from beating kevin   We had begun a child support case about   months later when he filed for it and won because he told the judge he had a stable job  he pays rent and that our daughter slept in her own room which is all a lie when he sleeps on a couch and she sleep in the living room  And i just feel like throughout this whole ordeal it s like justice isnt being served like he used me like a parasite  abuses me emotionally  mentally and physically then gets the keep our child  Like i know i can t be the only one that feels like this Let me know your thoughts Thanks Oceanic

149,0,My   M  girlfriend    F  is too paranoid or is it normal after what I ve previously done To start of I have know my gf  for years now during the start she rejected me so I tried to find someone else and when I did she gf   started showing interest and kept on chatting me until things started not working out with the girl gf   I was previously seeing so I broke up with her and tried courting my my now gf  we dated weeks after I broke up with  gf      So now after our relationship got started she started to scrutinize everything I did  and I mean everything  From where I am to what I m doing and to the point that she started asking where I got the things I am wearing  I dealt with it telling her and reporting everything even letting her access my phone to see whats in there  so now I report to her everyday from the moment I wake up to before I sleep  but after almost a year like this things just keep getting worse  I lost almost all of my friends which are girls because she did not want me talking to anyone of the opposite gender can t even like pictures or post comments now  I did everything I can to make her confident in me lost almost all social interactions with the opposite sex for almost a year now because she would go bathshit crazy the moment I talk to someone  but what it just got more worse  now when I send pics of my location she would video call me just to make sure I m sending something real and to the point she would track my location on an app just to see if I go somewhere else  These are just some examples of how paranoid and insecure she is and I don t know what to do know frankly I tried to talk to her  she cried and promised change but days later where back to square one   I know what I did previously was a dick move Jumping girls and all  but after almost a year of giving in  am I crazy for staying and adjsusting to her or is that normal  I do love her very much after all    Sorry for my horrible grammar and English 
150,0,Girlfriend who does drugs If your SO takes drugs  is it a turn off   I do drugs like ecstasy  shroom  LSD sometimes and my boyfriend told me that if I take it one more time  he s gonna break up with me    Thank you for the replies and I think I just have to sort this out  I don t take drugs everyday  I take it like maybe once in     months and whenever I go to concerts  I understand if I am addicted to it and take it frequently but for me it s just like once in couple months  Is it really that bad for him to break up with me if I take it again  
151,0,    m  I can t tell if the guy     m  I was seeing is still interested or notThis is probably going to be long  so apologies in advance     So last year I went through a short relationship and breakup that made me feel like complete shit  which made me feel like less than a human and broke my confidence in myself     In November I decided to try a boost my confidence back and try some dating apps  I was looking for friend with benefits  that also I wanted an emotional connection too    I didn t want a proper relationship as it felt like too much hassle after what had happened before  and I wanted my life in order first     I ended up talking to a guy  I ll just call him  J   total       in every way for me in terms of appearance and personality   He has this gentle soul vibe to him  and is very relaxed about everything   We also have a few things in common  and the differences interest me rather than push me away    I was a little worried at first that I was being impulsive or that things would just turn to shit if I did meet him  but after a week of thinking things over  I started talking to him again   After a few lengthy phone calls  One which was over   hours   I got a tiny bit pushy for the first time in my life  and we decided to meet at my place   He said he wasn t really looking for a relationship himself as enjoying the single life after his own break up the year before  and wanted to sort his own life out as well    I knew what he didn t want  but never really asked what he wanted  however I explained what I was after and he seemed cool with it     Sadly before we met  I fell ill and ended up in hospital needing surgery   So I had to cancel plans    I felt a small spark of feelings towards J when he kept messaging me to see how I was   After I got out  I was really into him  despite doctor recommendations  I told J to come over a week after I got out    Minutes prior to meeting up  I had a panic attack thinking I was being silly by rushing things so fast while I was in a mess from hospital  on the post op meds making me feel off  and had scars  decided to be open to him and just tell him how I was feeling  told J that he could make the choice between meeting me while I m in a groggy mess or wait a while longer     He decided to still come fortunately   We talked a bit  had amazing sex   despite three embarrassing things happening on my end due to the surgery recovery   and talked some more after    He told me mid sex he might have caught feelings me  I just smiled and we kissed after     The next day he told me he was going to be really busy for the upcoming while  didn t answer me if when I asked if we d meet again  but he still messaged me nearly every day  even if I didn t prompt him to     We eventually did meet again two more times in January  both amazing once again     On the third night he stayed the whole night without going home  I noticed I had a strong attraction to him and really enjoyed being next to him while sleeping  but I started over thinking that this isn t what he wanted and I ll probably scare him away and hurt myself     We continued to talk  but something he said gave me the impression he didn t want me getting close to his personal life  at least not yet    I probably took it the wrong way though  I started thinking maybe i should just look for a relationship on a dating app instead       It was a bad move though  nobody else interested me  I could only keep thinking about J  and I realised I was probably in love     Sadly when I decided I d get off the apps and maybe ask where things were with him  he didn t seem too interested in talking to me anymore   I asked him straight forward if we were done    He told me things were fine and he s just been busy but I wasn t really buying it  as he was still sending  or receiving snaps to other people     I pushed to see if he d meet me again  he said he might the following week  but then turned me down on the day   I made a dick of myself and phoned him  instead of being open  just asked if he s sure he still intends to see me at all  and if we were monogamous  as I wanted to see if he d say anything if I was going to find someone else    He promised me he was just busy  and he was monogamous in practice  but not pricable  but also got curious asking who I had found  and saying there s barely anyone decent left     He also said we could meet up on the weekend to which I agreed   So we met one more time at my place  mid late February  he was only here for about two hours  we had sex and talked a little  but not nearly as much before  could possibly have been my fault since I was kinda mumbling bullshit as I didn t want to say how much I liked him    After he left  I thought to myself I should just give him space if he s busy  if he likes me he ll contact me again  and if not  I ll let him go   After ignoring the last message I sent him in reply to his snap  two weeks without a message from him  and losing our BFF status on Snapchat  I assumed it was probably just me  and he was too nice to say he wasn t interested in seeing me again   So I had my moment of sadness  and accepted we were done   Sadly my Snapchat started screwing up and I couldn t access it  assumed if he ever tried to contact me again  he d try to reach my on my number or Facebook if I didn t reply on Snap    After a month finally decided to look for someone else  midst this  decided to fix my Snapchat and noticed some messages from him from two weeks prior  and some more recent     Obviously I contacted him and scrapped my plans to find someone else  he told me he s been down lately and his life is in a bit of a mess    Asked him if there was anything i could do to help  to which he was thankful but said no    Told him if he ever wants to meet up again to just let me know  he answered saying he will in the future but his life is just very hectic at the moment     That was the last I heard from him three days ago  there was also a rather large gap of time between his replies like he wasn t getting alerts  or just not interested in reading them      So to sum everything up  I m feeling confused    I don t know if he actually wants to see me again  or if he s just too polite to say he s done     I don t want to be a dick and find someone else if he actually is interested though  and I d happily wait for him    I also don t want to be needy  but for me  a week without contact is kinda excessive for someone I m sleeping with     Based on some things he told me  it s possible he could have some shit going on  won t say what as it ll possibility identfiy him   but he never said that it was part of his busy life or the problems currently going on     I do also see him on Facebook and Snapchat kinda often  like he s talking to others      I miss him and just want to hear from him more often  but I don t know if I should    
152,0,I think i need to move on and focus on my carrer  but i don t know how to break it down to my gf Me   m  and my gf   f  have been together for almost   years now  but she moved to a different city almost a year ago    About six months ago she has been struggling with health and i am struggling financially in order to pay for college    Since the health issues  she has been a bit more distant every day  although when we get to see each other  which is maybe once every month  things are completely fine  I still love her and all but sometimes i think it is a moment for both of us to sort our lives out and end things in a good note  
153,0,My    F  boyfriend    M  doesn t want me to move in with him and it s making me feel insecure about our relationship So we have been together only since October of      but my lease is up in August and he knows how badly i want to move out of my current apartment mostly due to my roomate situation  To me  moving into his place is a good economic move plus come August we ll have been together almost a year  Whenever I bring up the idea he gives me very vauge excuses for me to not move in such as he needs his space or that getting ready for work in the morning would be inconvient with both of us showering  the reasoning he gives are just such little details that it makes me feel like he s saying anything to avoid saying he just doesn t want to live together  That being said I m not sure what to do it makes me insecure about our relationship just knowing he can t picture us living together  He s never lived with a SO before while I have so maybe he s just nervous about it as that makes things more serious but that is what I want  a more serious relationship  So I m not sure what to do  is this a bad sign that he doesn t see a future for us 
154,0,Should I let her go  She constantly texted her ex about our problems during our relationship  I love her so much  She broke up with me and now she s back to texting her ex  What should I do So our relationship started in June        Everything was fine but I would constantly see that she was sad  She would tell me she was sad as well  I left for college and we had a long distance relationship  She had told me about her ex boyfriend and I really didn t mind it  One day she asked how I felt about her talking to him  as friends   I trusted her so I told her as long as you respect me then I have no problem  She said he had invited her to a concert  but she refused because she felt like that was disrespectful towards me    So about a month passes and she really wants to go to a concert  she tells me if I want to go with her and of course i do  She then told me she had invited her best friend  a girl  and she said no because the tickets were expensive  I was still okay with going  she was happy  She said even her ex boyfriend had said no  At this moment I got kinda mad  Like you really invited your ex boyfriend to a concert  and even worse  she did it before inviting her own boyfriend  I got mad and she said it wasn t a big deal  I let it go and we kept going    At this point it is around January      I m back in the dorms  and I m on FaceTime with her  I see that she spends a lot of time on social media  She had told me she didn t want to talk to her ex anymore because he was annoying  So I asked her for her twitter password  She gave it to me and I logged on through my laptop  I know it s not healthy but I went straight to the messages  I found so many messages between her and her ex  I found some were she would tell him about our problems and they would laugh about it  It belittled me  I found more messages with her and some friends  She would tell them how much she missed him  And she would ask if they thought she would have a chance with him in the future while being in a relationship with me   This made me angry  I told I was done  She went and she deleted every single message  She called me that night and begged me  She said she hadn t fully got over him but that I had helped her get over him  I forgave her because I was understanding    After this I sort of went into a defensive spot were I didn t want to get my feelings hurt  Everything went back to the same  We were lovey and everything  Celebrated our   year  happily  October      comes around  everything is fine   Before we worked things out she swore she would never talk to her ex again   So I m at her house and I see her checking if I m paying attention to her  I know something is up so I try to reach for her phone  and she fights me with all her strength  At this point I know something is up  I took her phone and saw her dms  She had messaged her ex and was having a whole conversation with him  It seemed like she had a better time texting him than me  She swore it didn t mean anything  I ended up forgiving her again  So fast forward to today  She broke up with me because she said I didn t make her happy anymore  She said she felt like I stopped trying after everything that had happened  I do admit  after reading the message of her saying if she had a chance with her ex I sort of put up a wall    I didn t want to be seen as the idiot that went out with a girl only so she could leave him for her ex  The night she broke up with me  the one person she went to first was her ex  She seemed to really enjoy talking to him  I took her out on a date because I didn t want to lose her  And I asked her about it  She said she only went to him to make me mad and because it was easy to talk to him  She says she doesn t se him in that way or anything  We got back together  after a wonderful weekend together  But she kept talking to her ex  After two days of being back together she told me things didn t feel the same  and she wants happy  I understood  I feel really bad about just letting   years of our relationship go to waste like that  I know I was distant but I truly love this girl  We still text daily  but she takes longer to reply  I know she s texting her ex instead of me  I can t get mad because we re not together    She gives me mixed signals  I asked her if there was hope for us and she said we ll see  I don t know if her ex is putting thoughts into her head  She tells him about all her problems  I know she loves me  I just feel really lost  Should I keep trying to win her back  Should I be mad that she s texting her ex more than me  Should I just leave her alone  She said it wasn t fair that she felt rejected by me this whole time  but this whole time I felt like I was the second choice  What should I do 
155,0,My    F  ex is in a toxic relationship and I    M  don t know if I should do something Okay  First I know I should normally not interfere with my ex new relationship  this would obviously be none of my business as my relation with her is over   I think its important to know that our relation ended on very good terms  We did not fight or anything  we just didn t love each other enough to continue  Its been   years  we do not talk alot except for usual  how s your life now     second chat when we happen to see each other at the bar or some other places   However  she recently texted me     time    month appart each time  for some advices  She told me what her relation with her boyfriend is like and that she doesn t know what to do   She told me that her new boyfriend would smash things when he gets angry and scream and tell her she is crazy  He gets very jealous over little things  Me telling her happy birthday on facebook for example   I don t know if I should say this but she also told me he said he would kill himself once for a reason relative to their relation   When she texted me  I stayed very carefull in what I said because I don t want her to act on my words but rather on her own decision  I told her that I dont know what her relation is like  but what I know is that she is a good person  not crazy and that I beleived texting me about all this should make her think more about what relation she wants   It really hurts me seeing her like that  I know she was crying while she was texting me and I just wish I could tell her to end it  I want to really talk with her  not only texting  But at the same time  I don t know of its my place to do all this since im her ex   What should I do  Wait for her to text me crying again  Ask her to come take a coffee to discuss   Text her   To say what   Tell one of her friends   I really don t know     Sorry if the level of English is bad and if there are mistakes  I did my best  but this is not my native language   Thank you   Edit   I think I messed up the title  I am   M and she is   F  
156,0,Me    F  pregnant  and my husband    M  fighting about sleepI m sorry this is long  It feels like a complex issue but maybe it s not  tl dr at the bottom    amp  x   B   My husband and I have been together for     years  He s GREAT and I love him and plan on being with him forever    amp  x   B   We have issues with sleep  He snores and also watches TV iphones while the TV is on after I ve fallen asleep  His snoring wakes me up every night  When it wakes me up I wake him up and tell him to change positions  I also have always had a tough time falling asleep and used to take sleeping pills but stopped that years ago and started smoking weed before bed   but now I m pregnant and can t do that    amp  x   B   We ve tried a lot of things  I have a great eye mask that I can put on and he can still watch TV without the light bothering me  He also turns the TV way down after I ve fallen asleep   which I always thank him for  We have a white noise machine  if I m awake and he turns it on I say thank you   I wear earplugs most nights  even though it really hurts my ears and I have chronic irritation from them   and he s started wearing a chin strap thing  surprisingly effective   All of these things help but it s not perfect and there are still nights where I can t handle laying awake for hours  listening to snoring  and not being able to fall asleep even though I m so tired  On these nights I go sleep in our guest room in the middle of the night  Doing this doesn t bother me and I don t resent him  it s not his fault he snores  and I wake up happy and rested  Sometimes he goes and sleeps in the guest room if he gets tired of me waking him up to tell him he s snoring and to change positions    amp  x   B   Having a guest room and using it occasionally  sometimes  x per week  to get good sleep seems like a great solution to the sleep issue to me  My husband strongly disagrees  He is very upset by the idea of his wife sleeping in a separate room  x per week  Most of the times when I am gathering my pillows to go sleep in the other room and he realizes what s going on he gets upset and gives me a hard time about it  This is strange to me  because there have been nights that he knows I really need sleep that he has proactively fallen asleep in the guest room  so that I can get good sleep   I should mention that I never give him a hard time about sleeping in the guest room    amp  x   B   So   last night was a bad one  I m    weeks pregnant  EXHAUSTED  this is a normal side effect of the  st trimester   and I had a migraine headache all day yesterday  Sleep is the only thing that I could do to not be in pain  I fell asleep while my husband was watching TV  but got woken up twice by laser explosions from the TV show  I said   ok I m going to sleep in the guest room and my husband got up and started trying to help  saying  fine I ll just turn off the TV   turned all the lights on  started trying to find my eye mask for me  which I knew we could not find since we just got back from a trip and it was in   of   bags somewhere in the house  etc   Even if we found the eye mask  turned the TV off  turned the sound machine on  I knew I still would have interrupted sleep because of the snoring and I just wanted to go to sleep I was so tired and my head hurt so bad  He then started in again about  I don t want to sleep in a separate room from my wife  x per week   in a hostile tone    amp  x   B   At that point I got pretty upset and started freaking out and saying  I just want to go to sleep  Why are you trying to control where I sleep   Why does it fucking matter     I don t remember what else I said  but I wasn t being nice   I think I said something like  I don t fucking care where I sleep as long as I can fall asleep right now  I feel like I m dying   I was really tired and had already been woken up twice and I was in so much pain  Anyway   when I said the thing about him trying to control me he grabbed his pillows and went in the guest room and slammed the doors  I got great sleep    amp  x   B   Now we re in a fight  but to him it s about how I talked to him last night after the conflict started   and for me it s about the recurring issue of him giving me a hard time for occasionally sleeping in the guest room when he keeps me awake   How can we figure this one out since we re going to be together forever and I don t want to fight about something as basic as sleep  How can I advocate for myself getting good  healthy sleep   even if it means occasionally sleeping in the other room without getting in a fight about it   tl dr  I have a hard time sleeping because of husband snoring tv sounds and my husband doesn t like it when I sleep in the guest room    amp  x   B   Edit  I should have mentioned that my husband went to the doctor about snoring last year  did a sleep study  does not have sleep apnea  isn t overweight  and works out regularly  The doctor said his breathing passage is just  narrow      and recommended breathe right strips

159,0,I    F  have a hard time expressing feeling wants  Whenever I DO actually want something and express it  I end up feeling devalued by those close to me As a person  I m fairly passive in my ways  I don t know why  but I might have a specific want or desire and ignore it in favor of others  or it ll be a very passive day where I m not wanting anything at all    For the most part  not all the time though  people figure out that I don t tell people what food I want what I want to do etc  and try to start asking  Which makes me feel  I don t know  valued  and like  maybe  I can start to express the things I do want when I rarely do in fact want them  I just have a weird time expressing myself around people   However  lately I ve felt really bad about the times I ve started to ask for things I  really  wanted  Most I can reasonably accept as they re jesting wants like I ll crave Chipotle at midnight and they re closed so I don t care  but other times I ll  really  want something and try to be honest   Such as with my significant other    NB   If I m being honest I  really  wanted sex last night  We had it maybe a day or so ago and I wanted it but not all that badly and I didn t explicitly ask for it because it wasn t that bad  I tried to be straightforward and ask  with the explicit statement that they could say no  and they said  we ll see  which basically was no  I m fine with them saying no  The only reason I feel bad is because there are other times  both with them  and my friend  that on the rare occasion I express something and ask for it straightforward it gets dismissed   I don t want people to bend to my whims  or do everything I desire because I rarely want something  I only really feel bad because I feel like I tend to put everyone s wants and wishes before mine  and in my head  though unintentional  everyone comes before me and I spoil everyone unconditionally  and lately  I ve kind of wanted that back  No matter how stubborn I m being  I want someone to see me as someone worth spoiling  or paying more attention to   Does anyone have any advice on how to not feel so devalued overs small things  Because it s starting to seem like small things hurt more than they should lately 
160,0,I  F     have only ever really dated women and thought I was a lesbian    I think I might be bi and want to experiment with guys but don t want to use someone s just to experiment  What do I do maybe this would be better suited to a sub like r lgbt or something like that  but I figured since this is a relationship specific sub you all might be able to help me   Back in middle and high school I was pretty heavily questioning my sexuality  I went on some dates with boys  and had a boyfriend for a year in high school who I now realize was really shitty in the relationship   that whole experience led me to believe I was exclusively attracted to women when I was thinking I was bi before   In college I was out as a lesbian and was only pursuing relationships with women   Wellll    I met this guy a while ago  we ve really quickly become really good friends over the like six months we ve known each other  and I think I might be attracted to him   We hang out a lot on our own  we re both single and looking for relationships  but I don t actually know if I m really into men   I want to try something  a mutual friend let me know that he s interested in me but hasn t said or done anything since I m out as a lesbian  but I almost want to see where this might go    What I really don t want to happen is for me to ask him out  discover that I m not at all into him or men in general  and then kill this perfectly good friendship   I m at such a loss of what to do right now haha 
161,0,I  F    can t go a day without bad thoughts about my bf even though he  M    Hasn t done anything wrongMe and my boyfriend have been having arguments quite frequently  constantly discussing things that upset me and why they upset me  the things that upset me due to me suddenly getting bad thoughts  thoughts that tell me that he looks at other girls  or that he s going to cheat on me because my mind believes it s impossible that I could have found someone like him  Basically just thoughts that haven t happened yet but my mind is telling me will happen and that causes me to freak out and to bring this stuff up with him instantly to get reassurance   I know he s sick of it  he s been dealing with this for a while and I m trying my best to prevent it but keeping these thoughts inside or reassuring myself just isn t helping me  I need to discuss these things with him  he usually does talk me down from every single one  until I bring it up again to make sure what I remembered was discussed from the conversation was right  Anyway my point is  that we fight a lot over the idea of something and not the reality of it and I feel like it s pushing him further away from me and yet I can t quite help to change it  Every single day me and him are so good  and I mean so good  We re the happiest we can be and then one thought will pop up and will ruin everything  I feel like I just ruined my anniversary and today again I brought something instantly and now our day feels ruined   I can get past these other thoughts for a while and it s because he can really help me get by them  even if we cry and yell  we manage to get past it and we both know that these thoughts won t draw us apart and he loves me regardless of this happening  But this time it was different  because it s something that does happen and isn t just a bad thought or idea of mine  and not even with just him but with everyone  I know he s seen other attractive people and that bothers me to no end knowing that he may find someone other than me attractive   He thinks a lot differently than I do  or maybe I just don t understand it completely but he claims he understands what makes someone attractive  like if he saw a model on a magazine  male or female  he could see why they may be attractive and why people find them attractive but that doesn t mean he is attracted to them and would want to be with them  He believes he can understand what makes someone attractive without being attracted to them  is anyone like this or understand this too   Everyone notices attractive people when they re walking in the street regardless of age sex etc  It bothers me to no end though that my boyfriend and I do it  Everyone does it but it s so bothersome to me  Does this bother no one else  It kills me every time I think about him even looking at someone else  I am very insecure  But regardless I feel like it should bother everyone in a relationship  Am I alone here  The act itself is just gross and disgusting  The fact that it s human nature makes it even more disgusting to me and the fact that we can t help it makes it even worse  Please tell me I m not the only one who has a very big issue with this  I just need reassurance or anything here that I m not alone  or that what I m thinking isn t entirely reality  or maybe that I m thinking too much perhaps  or should be thinking about this a different way   Please just give me advice on how to make these thoughts go away  advice about the last bad thought I had and how I can change to make this stop for my boyfriend  Thank you                                TL DR  I am having bad thoughts about my boyfriend even thought he hasn t done anything wrong  It makes the day really sad and I don t know how to prevent it  Also would like to know if it s normal for me to feel like garbage when thinking about how everyone looks at attractive people and that it s just normal human nature to do so  that thought makes me feel gross

164,0,Me    M  is having a hard time staying in a sexually incompatible relationship with my    F  girlfriend Hey everyone  My girlfriend and I have been together for almost two years  we have been best friends for about    Over the course of the year we have only had sex twice which is very tough for me since I have a very high libido  When we first started dating we had a lot of intimacy sexually but it has now been stale for quite a while now    My girlfriend is currently on antidepressants which I know are known to impact sex drive which was lowered around the time she started them  I have asked her numerous times to go to the doctor and explore other options but her answer always is  I will  I will   This has not happened yet  We don t see each other much anymore and that is partly because she works full time and I go to school work   Whenever I try to initiate sex it usually results in her saying no and her feeling as if she is not satisfying me being scared I am going to leave her    I really love this girl but without the physical intimacy aside from cuddling It feels more like a friendship at the moment and I am unsure of what to do   I feel as if at the moment we are just on different paths in life and that s okay  but I do not want to lose her  
165,0,My gf   f  broke up with me  m    early this week after   months of dating  My feelings for her have been on and off for the last   months of the relationship and now she wants to get back together  and I really don t know what to do So me and my ex got together in when we got to college together  we had been talking for a few months before hand online so we both felt like we knew each other well enough to start dating  Things were great our first  semester together  but early on in the second I started having doubts about my feelings towards her  It started out as a dream we re I had no feelings for her at all  When I woke up I was completely shocked and didn t want to believe that even in a dream that I had lost feeling for her even in a dream  But over time I started to feel like that more and more  I thought at first that it was just a passing thing and I would get over it  or that I would get over it  I really didn t want to end the relationship or tell her that I was having mixed feelings bec I really cared for her and didn t want to hurt her    So me having mixed feelings of her went on for about   months before I told her  which was earlier this week  Sunday   She ran out crying and I figured at that point I had ruined the relationship  I was really broken up about it bec I never wanted to hurt her and I think I still wanted to be in the relationship  I just didn t want to lie to her anymore  The next day  Monday  she asked to come up to her room to talk which I did  There she told me that I had broken her emotionally  And that she wanted to break up  She said maybe in time she would want to get back together  but not for a while  I felt like shit for hurting her as I did really care for her  Then about Wednesday she started talking to me again  she made it pretty obvious that she wanted to get back together  I don t know if I want to bec of my mixed feelings for her  As like one day I would be head over heels for her and the next I would just see her as like a friend with no attraction towards her at all  When I didn t have any feelings for her she would often try and make moves on me and I would feel slightly nauseous and really uncomfortable  but when it was a time I did like her we would both make moves on each other   I feel as tho some of my mixed feelings come from our differences  We have very different political views  hobbies  interests  and personalities  I m a very go with the flow person and she always has to be someplace super early and to know what she s going to do all day  She also is somewhat jealous as when I talk to other girls that are my friends she get jealous were I don t really care if she talks to her guy friends  Lastly she seems to be mad at me all the time for little things  such as making it so she was    mins early to a class instead of     or if I said one thing wrong in a conversation which I sometimes do and try to apologize but she won t accept for a while  Me and many of her friends think she may be bipolar  I don t mean to call her names I just genuinely believe she may be and I think she go see a professional about it  or something as her mood can change in an instant and it s really hard for me to deal with   Overall I am sry for such a long post  I just had a lot to say  I am really confused on weather or not I should get back with her as I still really care about her but I also still have mixed feelings about my attraction towards her  And I am sry for if anything is hard to read or if there are any grammatical or spelling errors 
166,0,My friend    f  just told me    m  that she has feelings for me  but she has a boyfriendFirst  I ll provide some background of how we met and our relationship as friends  Over the course of my life I ve had a few girlfriends and I thought that I had feelings for them  but that all changed when I met the girl we will call  Kate   I moved into my college dorm at the start of this school year and was introduced to a girl down the hall early on  From the minute I met her  we had a connection  I ve NEVER felt this way towards someone before and I felt like we just clicked perfectly  Every day the people in our mutual friend group would joke that we would make the perfect couple and such  The only problem  she has a boyfriend back home  I cared about Kate way too much to try and hurt the friendship we had or try to intrude on her relationship  A few months ago she transferred to a different college close by and I haven t been the same since  I feel like a part of me is missing  I continued to text with her every day  Until a couple days ago when everything changed   She was planning on visiting me this past weekend and we planned to go get dinner as friends  When the day came  she stopped responding to my messages and never showed up  I was hurt and confused because this didn t seem like something she would ever do  The next day  she texted me and explained everything  Apparently her boyfriend had broken up with her the morning of  She then explained that she has feelings for me and always wanted to tell me  The reason she didn t show up is because she was worried she would do something she would regret and didn t want me to think I d be a rebound or something  She didn t text me because she was too afraid to tell me  The only thing I could focus on is that she has feelings for me  However  the next day she said that her boyfriend wanted to get back together and she told him yes because although she has feelings for me  she still loves her boyfriend  So reddit  I don t know what to do  I care about Kate a lot and want to fight for her  especially after learning the truth   Couple side notes     When we were close  nothing ever happened other than light flirting  She wasn t cheating on her boyfriend or anything     She knows how I feel about her already     She has been dating her boyfriend for two years and that s part of the reason she doesn t want to end it    She told me she connects better with me than her own boyfriend   tldr  My friend told me she has feelings for me  but she has a boyfriend  I like her a ton and don t want to let her go

169,0,Thinking my girlfriend    f  of   years cheated on me    m  with mutual friend  Need help on how to get proof I ve been with this girl for over   years now and for the most part the relationship has been great  We re able to get along well together and generally make each other happy  There s also been times where each of us have expressed that we re not happy and that we should go seperate ways  Those feelings have passed pretty quickly though except that this one night was different   She came home from work visibly upset and when I aksed her what the problem was she only replied that she had been thinking about what she wants from life  I finally got it out of her that she was again thinking about ending the relationship because she believes we re not truly compatible and that I m not doing the  little things  that she needs  These little things that she s asking for are basically coming home with flowers and leaving sweet notes for her from time to time    After talking for about an hour she decides she wants to go out without me to clear her head  We have a mutual male friend that she s known for longer than I have  She has lots of guy friends so I generally trust her around them  At first I was apprehensive about it but she truly does have a hard time making girlfriends  It s just her personality  I also want to point out that in the past she s shown some pretty severe jealousy when I mention making friends with females  Anyway  she decides to meet this guy for drinks and to go to a Karaoke bar later   I just stay at home that night since I had to work early in the morning  I even spoke to the guy that night and he assured me that he wasn t going to let her drink much and that she would get home safe  I trusted him   It s getting real late now and I text her goodnight and that I love her and to have fun  I get no response for an hour which is unusual for her  I decide to call after that with no answer  About    seconds later she calls back asking what I wanted I tell I just wanted to tell her goodnight and making sure she was safe  She s had a past of drinking too much when she goes out without me and she drover herself there that night   She then begins to get extremely defensive and telling me she doesn t need me checking up on her and that I need to trust her more  I try to remind her in the nicest way possible that there have been many nights of her driving home drunk and that I m just checking to see if she s okay  She finally comes home around  am and wakes me up to again tell me I didn t need to call and check up on her  I just roll over and go back to sleep   The next two days basically consisted of us agreeing to end the relationship for various reasons  I think we eventually just got to the point where we both felt like we had said what was on our mind and to give it another shot  We re still together now and things are better but I just can t stop thinking about what really happened that night   There have been a lot of things that have happened to support my suspicions like   Finding her deleting text messages while she was in the bathroom  Him calling   days later after the night out  while we were in the car  and saying that he misses her  She then got real weird with him   We were out with him and some friends one night drinking when I started to jokingly poke fun of at her at the table  She then explained that I was pissing her off  He speaks up saying   Are you going to do what you did last time he did that   She pretended to not hear him   Any help here is much appreciated  I ll be around to answer any questions that you have  Thanks

171,0,Meeting up with my dadHi everyone  I m in a bit of a weird situation really  when I was younger I never knew my dad as my mum had me when she was young and my grandparents kind of pushed him away  this is what he says  so we ve never had a relationship until one night I was around     I came back from an all night rave in Manchester  had taken lots of mdma ketamine etc  And went into the local pub to ease the comedown   i no longer do this  and I got a tap on the shoulder and this fella introduced himself as my dad  Obviously I wasn t in the best state to deal with the information at that moment in time but after a few weeks of processing meeting him we met for a few drinks and had  the chat  he explained his side and it seemed to be going okay  Fast forward to today I m    now and live in the southwest near Bristol and we haven t spoken in a year or two  I don t know why but I just don t feel any sort of emotional or physical connection between us  he s kind of just a nice stranger who I try and call  dad  but as time goes on he s getting older and I don t want to regret not giving him a chance to be a father I suppose  we ve arranged to meet up a couple of times but I have let him down  I guess what I m asking you lovely people is where do I begin  Rather than meet for a pint or pints which admittedly is the easier option as it s less awkward etc  I was thinking a day out exploring somewhere  Has anybody experienced something similar  Many thanks in advance   TLDR  rekindling a lost relationship with my dad    
172,0,How to deal with girlfriends  interest  Me  black   m  My GF  Mostly European    F  has a thing for black guys  I m use to this  and it s been common in a few of my relationships  We have been dating for     months  and I didn t really think about it as much till now  All of her pst EX s were brown black  her porn history is FILLED with interracial porn  when we are relaxing chilling around I sometimes see her watching videos of shirtless black guys  all muscular ofc  and I told her it bothers me sometimes  she incorporates our color in the bedroom dirty talk    Now recently  my girlfriend doesn t have ANY friends  as in  I m the only one she talks to at all  I noticed she had a few black  friends  from high school that she just watches their stories and never talks to them   sometimes posting shirtless videos of themselves etc etc  she says she just watches their stories to keep up with their lives  but kind of just thinking this is bullshit   They don t really post anything about their lives in the stories  just what they re doing  or talking about random stuff  am I overreacting  It s sort of getting to the point where it bothers me that that s what she s looking at all of the time  which is fine if that s what she likes  not saying she shouldn t be doing that  just makes me uncomfortable  
173,0,Disappointed in myself  I feel like I did something wrong and need some advice from you guys   So there s this guy I met from Florida a few months ago and me and him have been talking for months  exchanging flirty messages  videos of ourselves  not nudes   he was very sweet  said a lot of really sweet things to me about how much he d like to be with me and etc etc  so he was supposed to come to NYC to finally meet end of April    Out of no where his training partner liked one of my pictures on Instagram   nights ago  then I liked   of his just to show love back  then he replied to my story and followed me on Instagram  So I followed him back  Didn t reply to the message only liked what he wrote on my story  So then this guy I ve been talking to unfollowed me then followed me again  Then I messaged him asking why he unfollowed me  he responds with  why are you following my training partner lol  so I responded well he followed me first so you should be asking him not me  then he write  nah it s cool  and then yesterday morning unfollows me  I asked him why he unfollowed me again and no response then I wrote him again  are you really mad that I followed your training partner back  You followed one of my teammates too   And still no response       why is he doing this  What can I do  Is there even a point to try to fix this  This actually really did hurt me  I haven t opened myself up to a guy the way I did with him since my ex so it hurts even more and the fact that he unfollowed me affected me a lot too  I feel if he just left everything alone it wouldn t hurt me as much  Mostly because He makes me feel like I made a huge mistake  Now today  a day later after he unfollowed me he went to my profile and erased   of the pictures that he commented on but left the rest of the pictures and left all the likes he left on my pictures and the rest of the comments he also left  Also we are still friends on Facebook and Snapchat  Maybe he forgot we are friends there because we talk more through Instagram anyway  
174,0,I think my girlfriend is cheating but I m not      sure  Should I wait or address it now My girlfriend has made herself pretty trustworthy since I ve known her since August  We ve been  officially  together since January which matters for the topic  She seemed all for it for a couple months before then but apparently I was the one that needed to really start the talk to make it official   Besides all that  I think she s cheating because one day she had to use my computer to use her Gmail so she could print something  She s still been logged in since then because I rarely ever use internet on my computer  She went to a monster truck show with her kids and recorded a lot of stuff and since I knew she uses Google photos a lot I figured I d check out some videos there  None of those were there but from Snapchat an ex s dick pick was there as well as a screenshot of him asking her who she s with  Her response was  What s your email    This happened late February  I m telling you guys she s making sure I know she s      for this relationship   I wasn t a snooper before but I turned into one  The Gmail that I have access to is probably a lite account  has none of her phone  internet or subscriptions to apps or whatever sending information to it    I wish I could say I was being paranoid but that s as close to hard evidence as you can get without it being actual proof  Where do I go from here  I really feel like I should just break up with her

180,0,I    m  am not feeling loved by my wife    f It s long  but context matters and I m in a pickle    I ll try to stick to the basics    m married to   f for   years  no kids  I felt an incredibly strong connection to her like no other when we met  and well through the first   years  We married after a year  which we understood the risk of  but I think we both felt a real connection    From the get  all the big picture items lined up  So everything you think you d want in a partner  we matched  She was independent  had her own place  and seemed to have it all together  We both work full time  albeit I have a more stressful career    Sex  While dating  sex started off at a matched tempo  but she made it clear she wasn t highly sexual  That was okay with me because I m busy and we still had it enough that I wasn t worried at all  After being married  it was a sharp drop off   Even a honeymoon in the most sought after destinations in the word  we had sex   times in    days  After returning from a deployment  it was   weeks before we had any  Another deployment  we had it first night  so she acknowledged it was hard on me  Overall I don t think I have high expectations  I m pretty vanilla  but it s like     times a month and I literally Have to ask and plan it with her  She ll always say tomorrow  and then she s tired from work or puts it off again  I know sex tends to decline in marriage  but I imagined in    years  not    It s not a hate for her  but she s said she could live without sex in her life   House care  I admit I m pretty type A  in my ways and very clean  Virgo  She s helped me let go of certain over the top expectations  but she doesn t seem to meet me halfway  I ve NEVER seen her vacuum  clean a bathroom  put away her clean laundry  sweep  etc  Shes an only child from an affluent family  I grew up the youngest of   in a lower class family and I did chores always  You just cleaned up after yourself  Every week when I m cleaning up  I get angrier and angrier  without saying anything  that I m the only one doing it  She ll just be watching tv or at the gym  and I m cool with that because I just want her to relax and feel like I m taking care of her  Even though I ve worked all week  as she has  I try to keep it clean as I go  She just lets it pile up and then I always do it  This is a big issue for me  We ve talked about it multiple times  she always feels bad and says she ll do more  but alas     Love styles  I wear my heart on my sleeve but very logical  I like to show my affection  but she doesn t  I don t think  once  she s hugged me out of nowhere  And I do know for a fact she s never said I m looking good or handsome  I think we re both attractive  I have to use tact re  how often I tell her I love her or how gorgeous she is  because she gets put off in a manner  I was willing to take this at the beginning  but it chips away at me after this long    Kids  we re both kind of on the fence  Not really a hot button issue    Other  she hasn t officially changed her last name  though she always said she would  I do feel like she s always secretly doubted the success of it all  and was scared to commit  I don t think that s stupid per se  but I do think it casts a dark cloud  If I m showing I m fully committed  but she s not  then I begin to question my stance    Her parents and mine  we re on the west coast  where she s from  I m from the east coast  and my parents are still there  My moms crazy and neurotic  but she has good qualities  My wife has maybe texted her twice in   years to say thanks for a gift my mom sent her  I ve gotten my mom to give her space since her relationship with her own mom is rough  but now I think it s very fair to at least text her on holidays and let her know she s doing well  Just common courtesy  really   She and her mother have issues  but I think my wife gets herself into most of the tiffs  Sometimes yes her mom is being a bit extra  but I think she just wants her to have a happy life marriage    Reasons I haven t quit  we re really good friends  We laugh and have a nice life  we respect each other s work ethic  Neither of us have substance issues  both really into fitness  Her parents are fantastic and don t reflect her styles at all  Literally great friends with everyone in her family and extended  She and I clique the way you d want to be best friends with your spouse    Reasons I m debating have a very adult conversation  after my first deployment  she said she thinks I m just in it to prove that we didn t make a mistake  I show love and effort  every day  but I absolutely never feel it reciprocated  We re still kind of young  and without kids or larger commitments  it might be easier  My sex drive is absolutely not being met  and although neither of us has been unfaithful  I find myself wanting to be with other girls  Admittedly  some have come on to me and I feel like I need it  I know that sounds douchey but that need is not being met   Again  never cheated    I know it was long but if you made it this far  I d appreciate your thoughts  especially if this story hits home  I may have forgotten stuff but I think this covered it  Thanks folks 
181,0,My girlfriend  F    feels like she can t open up to me  m   about certain things  So it all started off   or   months ago  when we were discussing some of her fears about a scar she had  She had told me how she felt disgusting with it and wanted it gone as soon as possible  She then said she was going to try to get it surgically removed from so she would feel a lot better  I replied by telling her how i thought she was beautiful even with the scar on her and how other people have worse scars than what she had  She then replied how that s not what she expected to hear from me  referring to the latter part and how she felt even worse because of it  I realized why she said that and I apologized profusely and made sure I understood why it was the worst thing I could say  Flash forward to yesterday when she told me how she didn t like how she could open up to her friends more than me  It hurt me to hear this because I was trying to be mindful of what I m saying to people and how they feel about the topic at hand  Especially since I hurt her with the remark about how someone else had it worse than her  I really do care for her and I don t want her to feel like I don t and don t want to hear what she has to say  Is there anyway I can regain her trust  if that s the right word  because I don t want her to feel like she can t come to me when she needs help 
182,0,Should I    F  with my boyfriend    M  before or after work trip Long story short  the end is nigh   I ve been debating breaking up with my partner  dating for about   years  for quite a few months now  and was on the cusp of following through just over a month ago  However  realising that I hadn t been putting it any effort into our relationship lately  I felt it wasn t fair to break things off without really giving it a shot  I ve tried to change my mindset and attitude towards the relationship  but some of my biggest dealbreakers have been broken and I know it ll be better for us both in the long run   He s recently gotten a promotion and will be heading off to a different city next week to learn the ropes  He s gone for about a week   Now I KNOW that it s best to just bite the bullet  but I still want to be considerate as possible  I m wondering if it s cruel to split up just before he leaves  as he ll be in a different city without friends  family etc and will be with people he doesn t know  Essentially  I m worried about a lack of support and that horribly  lonely and empty feeling of going to an empty hotel room at the end of the day  I also don t want it to affect his engagement at the work conference   I won tickets to a concert during the week  before he goes  and I ve avoided telling him  mainly because I think I d feel uncomfortable having to  fake  my excitement  I always want my feelings to be genuine and I know it s not fair to cloud that to him  Also not sure how to go about this as I ll obviously have to tell him    Should I do it before he goes  ie  Within the next few days  or wait the extra week   This is the first time I ve ever broken up with someone and I m definitely finding it a lot harder than I thought it would be  Any extra advice would be so appreciated 
183,0,Am I being a huge dick or is this understandableWhen my girlfriend      and I      first started dating she went on a contiki around EU and ended up sleeping with   people after about a month of being apart as she thought the relationship wouldn t last  Anyway she ended up coming home from her EU trip which was meant to last months and maybe even a year early after these incidents and everything was normal for a bit  Her friend then told me one night about what she did  the sex w   strangers and then lying to me about it  and after thinking about it I decided fine whatever since we had only been dating for a couple months and we re young I may have done the same who knows  that I d let it slide    months down the line and it still pisses me off a bit hurts and every time somebody cheats on t v or whatever I make these sly annoying comments like  oh gee that d suck hey   and constantly dig at her  I can see it hurting her feelings  sometimes she has a sad  but I keep on doing it every so often  My question is  am I being too much of a prick since I let it go and should be trying to move on  or am I ok to be a bit of a dick considering what she s done  Keeping in mind I don t intend to do this for the rest of our lives  just for a bit until it s not immediately on my mind anymore if that makes sense  Also any advice to like get my ass over it sooner coz I don t want to be pissed off about it still  I hardly care it s just so easy to make these retarded comments when something happens on tv or whatever  silly I know 
184,0,So I    f  fucked up and I know it  Slept with my ex s friend    And then threw it in his face  facepalm So my ex and I didn t have the clearest relationship from the start  I ll just list it so far    He was a good friend of my older brother so me and him dating caused problem in my family  bro felt betrayed by both of us becuz  bro code  about dating sibs but whatever        When we started dating  he was also seeing four other girls  I was unaware of this One girl came to me  as a woman  and then we all found out about each other and I was crushed  I had never been cheated on  So stupidly in love  I gave him another chance and made him pick  hoes or me  He picked me  obviously     The whole cheating thing made me so insecure I made him delete all social media  He agreed and we moved on   There was only one other instance of infidelity on his side and we were in love and happy for   months     Fast forward to August    mo in at this time and we get pregnant  Unfortunately it wasn t our time and it didn t make it  I was devastated  but try to stay strong  and he started to pull away from me     In November      we broke up  he and I needed space to reevaluate  I wanted us to become more serious and he didn t want to grow up     Now we are in January and he reaches out to me  We briefly reconnect and start to try again  He again pulls away     February I meet F  I have never met F before but I heard about him loosely in exs friend circles     F and I end up going out a couple times purely friendly and then one night we got drunk and had sex    Note at this time I thought X and I were DONE DONE  I was wrong   X reenters my life and tries to make amends  it is very clear we are still in love    we end up arguing furiously with each other because I feel like he was back to his old stuff and I threw out the gem  that s why I slept with your friend   Worst thing I have ever done     Of course X loses his shit and demands to know who  but I do not want to throw him under the bus so I did not tell X who    F is also friends with bro so If I come clean I will have to deal with my bro s wrath of sleeping with two of his friends    So I guess I m asking is there anyway I can get X back  Preferably without telling him who  Also any advice on how to not feel like human garbage   
185,0,I    M  told the absolute love of my life    F  that I hooked up with two people in the first month we were dating We met on Tinder last year  During our first conversations  I knew she was special and someone I was deeply interested in pursuing  and we became friends before becoming intimate  which helped us build a foundation that ultimately led to a very fulfilling physical and emotional relationship  After talking for a few weeks  and already having some of the deepest conversations I ve ever had in my life  she agrees to let me take her out  During this date  she mentions that she is dating  and prior to this  mentioned that was not looking for a relationship  but that it could be subject to change  Upon meeting this woman my heart sank  she was twice as pretty as I was expecting her to be  VERY feminine  a HUGE point of attraction for me   and incredibly charismatic and inquisitive  She agreed to come back to my place  we made out for a bit  and then she went home  The second date a week or so later  she was so gorgeous that I was at a loss for words  my jaw practically hit the floor and I just fell short of drooling onto my shoes like a mad dog  She didn t want to hang out after our date  and in a point of feeling like I was having my heart ripped out  I went and had a one night stand with someone who I had never met before  and have never seen since  While I was in the act  I envisioned the girl I wanted to be with  and felt a crippling agony  as if I had conscientiously made the decision to betray her  I resumed pursuing   F as if this instance had never happened  and we went on to have another set of dates  that just kept getting better and better  After the  th date or so  I gave her flowers before dropping her off at home  with a card that told her I really felt strongly for her  needed some time to create the right kind of internal space for her  but was willing to commit anyways  Her response the next day was that she didn t know  and thought it would be best if we didn t connect that weekend  leaving things as they were  Devastated  I went and had another one night stand  with a completely different person  The next day  I chose to respect the wishes of   F  and let things remain as they were between us  I did not contact her  She contacted me  She said she had appreciated the space and wanted to continue seeing each other  This was mainly the most exciting thing I ve ever read  but it was also bittersweet  because I had forfeited the noble pursuit that I would have desired when courting someone who I could see myself spending the rest of my life with  but I struggled with lust in my heart  and even worse  the fear that she was behaving the same way that I was  Originally I had told myself that it was necessary to protect myself emotionally  since I had developed strong feelings for her in a time frame that most would consider to be far too early  and therefore  disingenuous  But in this moment  where she indicated that she reciprocated my strong feelings for her  I wanted to tear myself apart for being so insecure and lacking such sincere integrity  From this point on I have never cheated  though have had some lingering temptations  These became easier to manage over time  especially after we became intimate weeks later  and went on to declaring ourselves to be in a relationship with one another   Sorry for the longevity of this post  Now to the point  Fast forward half a year later  we take our first plane trip together to meet her family  who embraced me well  and I loved all of them  As we deepened our connection together at this level  I felt the regret of my actions while we were dating begin to writhe through my soul and I fell just short of telling her  while elaborating on how I ll sometimes get impulses to think about other girls  A poor acknowledgement to make to a significant other  Why would I mention this when it has the potential to hurt her  There was a time before my life when President Jimmy Carter once stated publicly  I struggle with lust in my heart   When my father once told me this  I thought  even if people were not receptive to this  here was a man who admitted he was human  and had enough nerve to say so  even when he could be cast out for it  I believe this woman in my life to be equally worthy of such a consideration  even though it led to me crying at her feet  I had decided that I would no longer keep my dating history in our first month a secret  because if I were to tell her years from now  after taking more meaningful steps together  that I would be further betraying her trust by allowing myself the safety net of her becoming far more emotionally invested  without having access to this information  I had sought to protect her from this reality  in fact  I had planned to die with this secret  I knew it would hurt her  I knew it would jeopardize our future and her ability to trust me  I knew it would lead to her feeling that I still wasn t giving her the full story  So for those of you in a similar situation consider this  Do you love your significant other enough to accept the fact that whether or not you cheated within the defined parameters of a monogamous relationship   it would be worth breaking her heart in the name of coming clean  and attempting to demonstrate the depths of your desire to be completely trustworthy  What if she will never trust me again  I am having total buyers remorse  I could have continued to draw from the pain I have caused myself  in order to remain faithful  as I will always continue to be  I could have done it without eroding everything special we ve built together  where no cheating took place  without it now feeling like something did take place  I wish I could have had enough faith in myself  and in this new romantic interest I had last year  to cast aside all worry and desire in the name of an honest pursuit  I truly love her  and would do anything to repair the damage I have caused  She is deeply hurt by what I have told her  and I ll never know if things will be better off now that I have

188,0,My sister    F  claims she was raped but I    F  don t believe itI feel horrible admitting this but I just don t  The reason is because my sister is the stereotypical psycho girl  She becomes obsessed with guys and stalks them  It started when she was teenager  The parents of a boy she dated called the police on her for harassing their son when she was     She develops an obsession with every guy she sleeps with  It s not a case of them using her or not making their intentions clear  She d met a guy and sleep with him the same day then declare him her boyfriend  When he doesn t return her affection  she gets mad and stalks him  She also goes for guys in relationships and men way older than her  She slept with one of our mom s friends who was also the father of her best friend  Honestly  she becomes obsessed with guys who show her any kind of attention  Recent case in point   She met a guy while waiting at the DMV  They made some random small talk  She didn t get his name so she kept going back to the DMV in hopes of meeting him again  She gets lucky and runs into him at the store  She gets his name and number  She finds out he has a girlfriend and child  She gets mad and tries to get him to break up with his girlfriend  He breaks off the friendship contact  Cue her acting like a crazy bitch  Mom gets a call one day saying she s in the hospital and has been drugged and raped  Frenzy ensures  She doesn t press charges but goes around telling everybody he raped her   I don t believe her and neither does mom  In fact  mom told her that she didn t believe her  She got pissed and called mom all kinds of nasty names    I guess what bothers me is that I      believe in trusting the victim  But I feel strongly my sister is lying  On the slim chance she isn t    Well  I don t know  I think false accusers should face some kind of punishment but since she didn t press charges  I guess there s nothing that can be done  I feel bad for the guy 
189,0,My    M  son   M  cannot get along with my wife    F   and it is destroying our marriagePosting this on a throwaway account and really trying to look at the situation on both sides  because I may share this with my wife     I have been with my wife for a bit over three years  married since last November  Our relationship is honestly pretty great  We get along very well aside from some spats here and there  and she stuck with me during a pretty messy divorce   bad situation with my ex  I love her dearly     The problem is my son and the relationship  or lack of  he has with my wife  To provide some context  my son is on the autistic spectrum and has some significant behavioral issues  He seems to lack empathy in many cases  and his behavior both in school and when he s with me has gotten progressively worse over the past couple of months  My wife and son have never been incredibly close  despite my wife s efforts  and believe me  she has tried to build a relationship with him  She is now at the point of giving up and doesn t really want much to do with him     Things did notably improve after some rocky periods early in the relationship  so we married last November and were really happy  This year  however  my sons behavior has escalated in a big way when he s with me  and it s boiling over  We have tried everything from a discipline perspective and have also tried going the nice route where we have care free times on the weekends I have him  Time after time though  he has behaved badly at school and then acted out when we try to discipline him while I have him     Within the past month or so  it has gotten so much worse  My son s behavior makes it seem as if he is actively trying to drive a wedge between my wife and I  and it s been working  We ve had several huge fights over this and how it needs to be handled     While I don t have the answer on how to start improving things  I don t agree with what my wife wants to do  She is asking for us to act like he is dead to us when he s over for the next month  basically us ignoring him during that timeframe except for his basic needs of food  etc  Her argument is that he needs to understand that there are consequences to his actions  and there will be no attention  positive or negative  while he s behaving this way     While I know his behavior needs to be addressed  she is      dug in on this  I reluctantly agreed a couple of weeks ago to do this  but when the weekend rolls around  the thought of doing this to him makes me feel sick to my stomach  I have come up with excuses with his mom to not have him  because I have not wanted to do this  While he needs to know that his bad behavior is not acceptable  doing what she wants to do seems excessively cruel to me  I told her last night that I don t think that I can do it and it really does feel like I m having to choose between her or him  She s saying that she s just asking for a month of this and is now questioning the entire relationship     I m really trying to look at both sides here and really do feel bad that my wife is having to deal with this  But my son is  well  my son  I love him dearly  despite his problems  and I don t think that doing what she s asking will help with anything  Again  these are my feelings and I don t know if it s the truth  but it is feeling like this is some kind of  test  she s giving me that I m failing horribly and that I am having to pick between the two of them     Does anyone have any advice  Is my gut feeling on this wrong  There is a lot more to all of this than I can type  including the dynamic with my ex and true lack of co parenting  but it just seems that my son is stuck in all this crossfire  Desperate for any advice  
190,0,Is this guy a narcissist  I need help please  This guy I met and started talking to is showing some weird traits and I think he might be a narcissist   He doesn t believe people are meant to be with one person forever so he doesn t like to commit forever  He thinks we should be with someone different every few years so we can learn and grow from different souls   Maybe that s spiritual   He does like reading spiritual and self help books   He says everyone works hard to buy a better house or car  and that doesn t stop with your mate   He tells me that he can feel he will achieve something really big and great and the world will know him and his legacy   He wants to change the world  I asked if he wanted to run for president and he said no that s too small scale  He s thinking about something bigger   When I asked him for more details  he says he doesn t know yet and if he can answer these questions  his dream is not big enough  And he s referred to himself in the third person a few times   He says he s meant to do something great here     not just to get married and have kids   Also we have argued about very small stuff since we have just been talking and hanging out for a couple months so there s nothing heavy to fight about yet  But I would catch him in little lies and he would just not admit it  I told him I was sad about something small he did and he turned it around and said I was being selfish   It seems like every time we bicker  he says it s my fault  Even if he yells at me he would say I m the one yelling and being crazy    He Tells me he does random hookups and i think that s fine since he s single and I do appreciate his honesty  He says even if he doesn t like the girls  he would hook up with them as long as they do all the work   Also he told me he cheated on all his exes and he thinks cheating is normal   Everybody cheats   He didn t sound ashamed or regretful   His dad cheated on his mom and he was a bartender so he saw lots of married people cheating at the bar   His brothers would always have different women around when he was growing up   He said he did a lot of shady things to women who have liked or loved him a lot and if his karma is to be alone  that s fine with him  He likes his space and has a long list of things to achieve in life   I asked him how he would feel if he was cheated on  He says he wouldn t mind because he understands that people sometimes grow apart and he doesn t take things personally especially what others do  He says he would still keep her around if the sex is good   He s friends with all his exes that he cheated on  I asked why they would still like him  He says because he changed their lives and he can still see himself in them  He made their lives better  He referred to himself in the third person here   I have to say here that he s a very motivated person  He works out every day and eats very healthy  He spends lots of money on healthy food and he s smart  He s always learning new things   He just told me he decided to become a doctor so he s looking into that   He says he doesn t care what people think of him as long as it doesn t affect him  his family and his money   But when he found out one time that he was my second choice to hang out with  he was acting all sad about it and saying he doesn t like to be my second option   I feel like he doesn t know what he wants because he sometimes changes his story  One time he told me he was looking for a serious relationship and it s hard to find a good girl he connects with  He told me he feels a different connection with me that he doesn t feel with other female friends  And I m a good girl  I never do random hookups   He says he is falling in Love with me and he likes how I m so innocent to what s going on in the world   told him he doesn t even like to commit   he said if he has a kid    he heard the love for a kid is amazing and he says that will be enough to keep him around  He says he will take care of his woman and kid but not get married  He doesn t believe in marriage and says people get boring after they are tied down  He wants excitement in life   He says marriage was created back then so men can own women for sex  That s why there are so many divorces because we are not meant to be married   What do you think of him  Is he a narcissist or spiritually Elevated  He says he is not normal and thinks outside the box

195,0,Telling my friend I ve started dating her exShort backstory   I ve been best friends for    years with my now bf  Originally I introduced him to my friend and they ended up dating for around   years  They ve been broken up for over six months now    A couple of weeks ago feelings started to develop  and me and my bf started dating    She doesn t know yet  I want her to hear it from me  rather than from somebody else    My friend and I are meeting next week and I wanted to know if anybody has advice on how to tell her    Thanks in advance   
196,0,My best friend is angry with me for adopting a dog that she wantedA little background  we ve been friends for about   years  She is a vet tech at a local clinic and previously professionally trained dogs  She herself owns   dogs    For starters  my sister bought a dog from an out of state breeder about   years ago  Recently this same breeder posted that a sibling to her dog was up for adoption  as he was returned to her by the couple that had purchased him  My sister excitedly sent the posting to both me and my best friend in hopes someone close to her could take him in    My best friend  we ll call her Jane for privacy s sake  wanted this dog  Jane and her s o make a good bit of money and would have been a very good home for him  However because of Jane s profession and background  found it hard to see me as a fit dog owner comparitively  I am not a professional animal care taker by any means  but I have owned plenty of dogs in my life  I grew up with     and own   cats and   snakes currently   There was a period of time where this dog was up in the air  and then it was determined by the breeder that I would be taking him  Due to the fact that Jane had previously expressed that she didnt see me as fit as her at caring for this dog  I chose not to share this with her for a short time  Once I did  Jane stated that she was avidly against me adopting this dog and was dissapointed that she herself didnt get him first  and angry with me for going against her recommendations that I not adopt a dog in the foreseeable future   In previous hypothetical discussions Jane and I have had about how deeply I missed having a dog  we discussed how I dont make as much money as she does  and at times can live paycheck to paycheck  I have always been well aware of the cost of medical care for pets  as I already own a few  as well as the cost of their day to day needs throughout their life  In short  dogs arent cheap  Though I am not exactly rich my animals have always been my number   priority and will never go without care even if it were to mean some discomfort for myself   I dont know how to proceed with her  Now that my sweet pup is living with me  Jane is continually pissed off that he is under my care and that that care is  irresponsible  comparatively to if he were under her or someone elses care   Do I apologize to her  Do I even owe her an apology  Do I try to make her see that yes  she would be a lovely fit for him as any professional would  but he is my dog  and he is also in good hands    I also pass this question off to you  is someone who has to budget out money for their pets immediately an unfit pet parent  Are those who have any and all the money in the world  for any foreseeable expense their pet may have  the only people who should own them  
197,0,What should I do in this situation Hey there  I    f  met a guy     or   m  on an app meant to meet people  potential partners  hookups  even just friends  etc   and we talked pretty extensively  I can t access that specific account anymore  it was locked and I can t recover it  sadly   so I can t check  but I m pretty sure his profile said single  Anyways  we got to the point of sexting basically where he compared my body parts to those of girls he had previously been with and started telling me what he liked to do in bed  etc  Normal sexting stuff  After I eventually said I had to go  he told me he didn t want it to be the last time we talked and gave me his number  A bit later that day  I curiously looked him up on Facebook as he had provided his real first and last name as well as face pictures on his profile  His about me section stated that he had been in a relationship since January of       I found the life event post on his wall from when he entered this relationship  found the girl s name  and a bunch of commenters saying congrats and that they hope he treats her right  This girl has kids  I think from another relationship  It s entirely possible that they re not still dating and just haven t updated their respective Facebook profiles  as I have done the same in the past  but I still find it fishy    What would you do in this situation  I can t really explain in detail what me and the guy talked about  other than I knew he wanted to meet me  have sex with me  and at the very least actually commit to sexting with me and giving me his phone number  I feel weird about the whole encounter and have not tried to use the number he gave me  nor had any contact with that guy since my account got locked  It just makes me feel kinda gross and I wonder if the girl knows about what he is doing  
198,0,   M  Need some helpful tips on how I can get my    F  Ex gf back So I ve posted a few things on here about this and I have gotten some useful advice about how I should look at things and stuff like that  Now I just need some tips about something that probably a lot of people may not be on board with   That is simply  I want to try to get my ex gf back  I know everyone s answers are probably going to be  Just move on  and honestly if thats what you re going to reply with save yourself the trouble  If I felt that she didn t want anything to do with me  then I would move on   I want to make a point that I m not someone thats all like  I cant live without her  or some dumb shit like that  I know I can survive without her if theres no hope of ever being an item again  I know theres other people in the world  But she s a catch and I fucked up big time   Thing is  I know I am perfectly capable of moving on  I just deem the relationship worthy of another shot  Obviously we broke up for a reason  and thats a point I can understand  But if I am going to be honest with myself  it was because of me  I devoted a good portion of my time into to talking with her  I didn t develop my own life outside of her   To put it simply  I didn t give her space and she felt suffocated  I didn t have a lot dating experience at the time and I hadnt realized that I had gotten emotionally dependent on her  And she got really distant because of this  I broke up with her because I couldn t really take it anymore  I know now that if I had just relaxed then  everything would have been fine   I just would like some tips on how to reconnect with her  And this time  I will take things slow  I am capable of giving her space now  I know what to do if we ever get back together  just need to get my foot in the door so to speak  We were great together as people  The relationship itself was amazing up until I got dependent  That s why I think it s worth a shot   I know begging her isn t going to work  nor have I done that  After we broke up and I realized what went wrong and that I still wanted to be with her  I gave her a lot of space and took the time to work on myself  I m not perfect  but I continue to better myself every day  I know that I cant just ask her to be with me again  I have to start fresh and reignite the spark  I just need some tips on how to go about that  like what to say and do   I already know giving her space is one of those things haha   To summarize  The relationship itself wasnt toxic and we made each other happy until I suffocated her and I think me and my ex gf can be happy together this time  I just need to figure how to get things rolling 
199,0,Not sure if I    F  should break up with my boyfriend    F  or if I m just being difficultI ve been seeing my boyfriend for only two months now and in the beginning everything was great until we put  labels  on everything and now it s kinda gone down the toilet   For background this is my second relationship and my first one lasted   months and ended in August       I was really torn up at the time of the breakup and when I met my current boyfriend I wasn t looking for a relationship so I explicitly told him that and he agreed saying he wasn t ready for a relationship since his last break up  supposedly    But then less than three weeks later he asked me to be his girlfriend  I agreed because in the moment I was in a good mood and we were also in the car together on a long drive so I assumed it would ve been awkward if I had said no    Since we started dating things have become quite mundane  Things just don t seem as exciting as they were in the beginning  There have been instances of him flaking on me a couple times  but the biggest red flag to me is that I feel like we don t have a whole lot in common  I ve been thinking here and there lately if we just don t work together like we maybe thought we would and maybe I just really am not ready wanting to be in a relationship right now and maybe I should break up with him   The event that has made me really consider ending things was tonight we made plans to go see  Us  and we were both super excited for it  but he said he wanted to go to a    pm show  I didn t have an issue with that and so I agreed  but then      rolls around and I texted asking if he wanted to meet at the theater or drive together     minutes go by  no response  At      I called him and the call went to voicemail  At      I texted asking if he was okay  no response    It s out of his character to be MIA like this  but the situation tonight combined with my preexisting doubts have made me really consider just breaking up with him now instead of dragging it out   My question is does it seem like I m being picky difficult  If I m justified in breaking up with him  what should I say  Would it be messy of me to say I m not ready for a relationship when I agreed to date him  even though I told him a few weeks before he asked me out that I wasn t ready for a relationship  
200,0,Boyfriend     constantly puts brother      over me    f This is my first Reddit post  I have a lot to explain so please excuse me if it seems a little messy  I m hoping to gather opinions on if I made the right descion or not as I dont have a ton of friends irl      As I said in the title I m tired of not being a priority for my boyfriend  We have been dating for over   years  and he lives with his brother  they also work together  I understand respecting family and all that but his brother  lets call him  Matt   treats him awful  If Matt is having his friends come over he will make BF clean everything  even if its Matt s mess in the first place  and won t clean anything himself unless it s very last minute  He has BF do the dishes all the time  and BF pays for Matt when Matt has spent too much money elsewhere  Matt has required that they have  Bro Days  where its just the two of them and I m not welcomed over  typically Monday and Tuesday      We have had a total of   Christmases in our relationship but I have not spent a single one with him because Matt freaks out  We tried to spend Christmas      together  he was going to be at my parents place with my family from  am   pm  Matt called at      and yelled at his brother for leaving him alone on Christmas  I litterally heard Matt say  I hope she s worth all the pain she brings me        Matt is almost always texting BF  even when were on dates  When I bring this issue up  all I get told is BF is too afraid to stand up to Matt  when I ask why I get  my past has tramatized me   I try to understand BF has had a hard time  but he wont open up to me about his past and any time I suggest going to talk to a professional for help I get  Yea I know I should        A bit more back ground info  just before we had been together for a year BF was hospitalized for a really bad infection  nurses didnt think he was going to make it  and he got  diagonsed with lymphoma  He was in the hospital for   amp     weeks  Matt didnt even try to visit everyday  his gf at the time told him he wasnt allowed to   I slept in the hospital next to his bed every night  Shortly after he got out of the hospital  we got promise rings  and he promised that we d get engaged soon      Recently Matt has been increasingly petty towards me  I work retail  at a smaller store where I often have to pull longer shifts and work weekends  My boss is great and tries to give everyone a weekend day off  For the past   years  so before I started dating BF  my off day has been Saturday and I work all day Sunday  typically             Matt has purposely been buying movie tickets for everyone midday on Sundays  for example     BF s cat had to go to the emergency vet on Saturday for a blockage  I ended up being the main person on a cosigned care credit card so we could afford the vet bill  Sunday comes around and he gets a call from the vet while they are playing a board game  I ask BF what news there was  Matt told me BF will tell me when they are done with the game       Monday night comes  I had just gotten off a long shift at my store and told BF I ll call him shortly to check up on the cat  BF asked if he can call me later  sure  its kinda late but they may be eating  I dont hear from him at all for the next   hours  I was getting increasingly frustrated and worried about the cat  I messaged him that I hope what hes doing is important and that they aren t just watching movies  they typically do on bro days   When BF finally responds to me he confrims that Matt wouldn t let him call because they were watching a movie      At this point I again ask the typical questions and then ask if I can stand up for myself as I m tired of this  He tells me no as it might make things worse for him  Then proceeds to grow himself a pity party   I don t deserve you  you deserve so much better than me  I m a piece of crap  stuff like that        I told him Wednesday we need a break  I explained that I was tired of being second all the time when I have given him everything and the person he puts first treats him so poorly  I need a break from the stress of it all  He just stood there staring at me  said breaks lead to break ups  I told him that I don t want a break up that we both need to work on ourselves before we can continue in a healthy relationship  because at this point our relationship is not healthy  He didn t get upset or really seem to have any kind of emotion he just stood and stared at me    Tldr  I have poured the last two years of my life into my bf who wont make me a priority over his brother who acts like he owns him and treats him poorly  I ve had enough rolling over for his brother s ridiculous demands and told BF we needed a break  Have I made the right choice in taking a break  Does it mean hes already given up since he stood silently and never even tried to fight the break idea 
201,0,How can I    f  convince partner    m  he shouldn t drive drunkLast night he said he was having some drinks after his course and that he would be home before dinner   I thought that was fine because he was coming home early and he would be driving  meaning he would only have   or   beers   Nope   He came back at   pm totally drunk  I expressed how I was against him driving while drunk and he said  it s ok I only had a few drinks and it was    min away   No matter how I put it  he was not shifting his point of view  So I want to talk to him after work tonight but don t know how to convince him  Advice please 
202,0,My     M  girlfriend     F  tries to make me feel bad after going on nights out with my friendsSo just for a bit of context  my girlfriend and I have been together for about     years now  It started as a high school relationship  and has now gone on into our second year of university  we re in the same school   We have messaged talked met up pretty much everyday since the beginning of our relationship  Another important point  is that she ended up falling out with her friend group at the start of our relationship  This ended up with her half merging into my friend group until she found her own group of friends in university   When we started our relationship  we were both into going out and partying most weekends  but over the years she has gradually cut down  due to her demanding college course  and long term illness   Before I go any further  I want to say that I m      comfortable being in a relationship with someone who doesn t enjoy nightlife drinking as much as I do   Recently  I have been going out a little bit more than usual  always without her  Every time that this happens  the next day she ll try to make me feel bad about going out and enjoying myself  She would never outright say anything to do this  but instead she ignores me for a day or two  which I m currently stuck in  and finding quite bizarre   This usually ends when we eventually meet up and have an uncomfortable hang out for a few hours   Personally  I find time outside of a relationship to be equally as important as time spent together  These nights spent with my friends are the majority of my social life outside of our relationship  I m currently conflicted about whether or not this is grounds for breaking up  I want to be able to enjoy the university lifestyle without this feeling of guilt looming over me when I wake up the next morning  but I m still afraid that I ll end up regretting my decision   I m fairly sure that I ll end it  there are some other reasons on top of this   but I would very much appreciate some thoughts on what you guys think I should do how to approach the situation   Thanks   TL DR  my girlfriend tries to make me feel bad by ignoring me after I go on nights out with my friends

205,0,Struggling with sex after a toxic relationshipI    F  have developed a lot of sexual issues during my first and only relationship  My now ex boyfriend    M  would get very upset at me if I ever said I didn t want to have sex whenever he did  often fighting with me for hours when I said no  This made me feel awful  especially because I have anxiety  so I made myself have sex with him even though I didn t want to for about   years  It got so bad that I began crying every time he initiated sex because I knew I wouldn t say no because he would be mad  but I knew that I didn t want to be doing that  It wasn t rape because he never made me have sex the times which I said no  I was just manipulated into feeling like I could never say no without causes major issues  Thankfully I am out of the relationship  but my view on sex is messed up now and I m just hoping that somehow it can get better  I ve noticed that now I m paranoid that every guy only wants sex from me and won t care about my feelings  even though I know that it isn t true  And feeling like I m going to be treated that way again makes me not want sex whatsoever  I don t know how to get over this and I m hoping maybe someone has advice or has gone through something similar  
206,0,Ruining my relationship with boyfriend with my own insecurities about my past both   Background   brought up catholic  Virginity is at the very core of my being  I was afraid to have sex and I used to think I was the bees knees because I was a virgin and any man would want me   these are things I was told by family and the church   literally since I was     Fast forward  just turning    and I had sex with an ex who didn t appreciate it  We broke up etc  Ended up having sex with some guy because I was lonely  I admit I loved it and I was happy with my sexuality   Fast forward I meet my boyfriend and that fear sinks in and those words   no one will want you if you lose your virginity to someone else  You should ve waited    He is also catholic and was disappointed that I wasn t a virgin  It took him some time to get over it but we have been strong for the past   months   It s been eating me up ever since and i feel like I wish I waited   and   that I m basically tainted and  I spoke to him recently and he said to not think about it and it s in the past  But I m still not convinced  He will probably bring it up in years to come or something  I don t get how you can get over something like that  Especially when his ex lost her virginity to him  I actually feel sick thinking about my past and I hate what I ve done   But this is literally making me feel out of love with my boyfriend  I can t explain it but I want to find faults in him and in us so that we just split up because I literally feel unworthy of love and I m worried that he still secretly thinks about me having sex with others   No he s not a virgin BUT the difference here is I don t mind he s a man and I wouldn t expect him to be one

208,0,My Partners life is very different and complex compared to mine  how best to support him  and adapt myself So my other half  M     and I  F     grew up in completely separate circumstances  We ve only been together a year and a half  but he s a very sweet  smart  funny guy and I believe he s very trustworthy    He grew up on the coast  in a city where many of his friends do Cocaine and many more have slept with each other  In fact he d slept with one of them before we got together  but I believe he s been faithful since   I grew up in the country in a small village where things were quiet and many older people go to retire  Two of my friends died when I was sixteen due to Cocaine use  one through accidental overdose and one through suicide  none of my other friends would touch drugs after that    Back in September I went to Japan for three months with my friends  the day before my flight he was going to call me when he got off work    But that night  at      am he calls me  he s rambling  then he says  sorry I can t focus  I am so baked right now     So when I got back we had the  drug talk   I told him it was fine if he wanted to carry on with his current lifestyle  but that he d have to do it without me  I wasn t prepared to experience any more heartache after losing two of my best friends  and the fear that precedes it    So he made his choice to get a better job  finish learning to drive  and as far as I know he s been clean for months now   We still live and work in separate places  so I get to see him every weekend  and I know he struggles to say no to his friends when they re shacked up doing Cocaine  it s also difficult when I m hanging out with them when they talk about drugs and who they ve slept with lately    I know it s none of my business what they do  of course  but my question is   How do I learn to adapt to the way things are in his life  and learn to support him better while he s moving on   I not only want to be a good role model for him  but someone he can turn to when things are tough  but he s starting to feel a little isolated and lonely    TL DR My boyfriend comes from a large friend group that does Cocaine and sleeps around  He wants a better future and to be more responsible  how can I support him better  and how can I adapt to being around his friends  
209,0,Me      and my gf      broke up in summer  mid August       but got back together some months after  November        Today she told me that some days after breaking up in the summer she had sex with another guy  with somewhat rapey dynamics  and has never told me anything about it  Idk what to do I m a    yr old guy  and my current gf and I got together for the first time in the June of       We liked each other  but I feel like we didn t love each other back then  so we were always quite awkward  but at the same time somewhat cute  In July  I left for the United States for the holiday period  and she went to supervise in a summer camp in France  where we both live  despite neither of us are French   We texted each other regularly  but I could feel that distance was deteriorating the still growing relationship we had created  Out of the blue I stopped liking her and I broke up with her by text  only then I realised it was a stupid move   I came back saying I was sorry  that the distance got to me and that I still loved her  keyword   loved    but it was too late  A few days later  her words   she and another one of the supervisors went for a walk  the guy being tipsy btw   The guy went  hey wanna go to my room  just to get comfortable   She accepted  not knowing that he wanted to have sex  He locked the door behind her and she started to think that maybe he didnt want to  only talk   She didn t want to  her words oc  but she said yes by fear  i never saw the guy nor she described him to me   so they had sex  i didnt ask for the details   Meanwhile  I wanted to give up on her after we broke up but then I created a plan to get her back  In November  I eventually did  We were a stronger couple and this time we both really loved each other  We went out alot  etc  Now it s almost April and its been almost   months since we have been truly together  She threw the bomb at me and now idk what to do  We are both going to uni after this year  and there is quite a high chance we are going together so I wanted a future  probably very dream like from a stranger reading this  with her cos i rly love her  I cant look at her the same way and i dont even know if she was expecting me to break up with her after this  Should I forget about it  Should I end all of this  I asked myself without reaching a conclusion so I wanted some external opinions  If you read this long I appreciate it  if u comment I appreciate even more  Thx

211,0,I m    F  grossed out about a thing my ex BF did many years ago    First I m new to reddit and also not a native speaker  so please excuse any mistakes in language and form    amp  x   B   So I ll try to explain everything as decent as possible  I don t really know what I m looking for  maybe suggestions on how to change my own behavior or maybe just another point of view on what I m struggling with right now       Just for some context  I ve been dealing with depression and anxiety since my early teenage years  As mental illnesses have never been  a thing  to my family and where always considered as a weakness of mind I never got any treatment until I was    years old and reached out for help by myself  Up until that point I thought I m self responsible for my mental issues and it s all my own fault and that I m just a weirdo who will never function in a normal way  I felt weird about myself in any social occasion up to the point when I felt anxious about even going out and meeting other people who could possibly notice my strangeness    amp  x   B   Due to my mental state there have been a lot of experiences in my teenage years that made everything worse  I was self destructive in any ways  talked to nobody about my feelings  began self harming due to feeling so guilty about being ungrateful for everything I had    amp  x   B   At age    I already had lots of self destructive thoughts and started dating a guy my age from school I wasn t really attracted to  I still can t explain why but I think I ve just been craving the feeling of safety and someone who would call me beautiful so bad I couldn t resist  I also thought I ll never find someone else because of being unlovable and didn t want to be alone for my whole life  So I gave in to his advances which was probably the biggest mistake of my life  The following two years where like hell what I obviously wasn t aware of back then  He was emotionally abusive  he isolated me from everyone  what wasn t really a big deal for me as I wanted to be with no one anyways   I lost my hobbies and my friends that have been very few anyway  I couldn t even talk to other people at school without him being jealous and pissed for days  As I couldn t stand him ignoring or even leaving me and because of my unconditional need for comfort I did everything for pleasing him  I was trapped and didn t even notice how unhealthy this guy was for me    amp  x   B   As I wasn t really physically attracted to him and my sexual drive was additionally supressed from birth control pills and depression  we had sex very rarely  And of course this was bothering him  I knew that  But I just couldn t sleep with him at most times even though I wished I could  Sometimes I was doing it just for gratifying him  I was staring at the ceiling and letting him do his thing  Yes  it s disgusting  And I felt disgusting    amp  x   B   So there was one thing that happened during that time repeatedly I never talked to anyone about  not even my therapist  I feel so ashamed and grossed out and never really knew how to tell anyone what happened  The thing is that he was masturbating every night laying next to me in the same bed when he thought I was sleeping and not noticing  Often he touched me while doing it but I just pretended to sleep  I m always asking myself if this had any impact on my future relationships and sex life  I ve always stopped sleeping with my future partners on a regular basis after a few months of seeing each other  I m also asking myself if I can actually blame him for what he was doing because of the fact that I denied sleeping with him  I m just feeling so ashamed for the whole situation I was in with this guy  That he did all this emotionally abusive and manipulative stuff to me and I stayed with him for over   years anyhow  What s kind of funny is that we finally broke up because he cheated on me with a friend he had for years and they are married today    amp  x   B   I just want to stop feeling this guilt I felt for so many years but I don t know how  And I don t want my past and mental issues ruin my current relationship as happened before  My most serious relationship was about   years long  At first we had a fulfilled sex life  but after around one year I pretty much lost interest  He was always such a good boyfriend to me  he stayed with me during my darkest hours of depression and anxiety  I was so afraid About him leaving me that I started emotionally manipulating him myself as if I copied the behaviour of my ex  I m definitely not proud of it and I feel sorry for everything I did and that I made everything so complicated even though he was such a good guy  I know I was acting like this because of my insecurities and fears of loss but nevertheless I was a selfish bitch    amp  x   B   The relationship ended because at some point it just stopped working out for us  We were living together at that time and when he left and moved to another city it felt like I lost everything secure in my life  We are still friends and messaging each other sometimes but I still miss him and crying over him when I m feeling down    amp  x   B   I met my current partner    M  about one year ago and we are dating for   months now  He has mental issues himself and we had that special connection of just understanding each other from the beginning  I feel like he knows me better than anyone and I told him things I never told anybody else  I just want to get my shit together and make everything different this time  I already started having that tendencies of manipulating him because I m constantly craving for some kind of  confirmation of his love   does anyone get me here  I really really try to stop my evil thoughts about not being good enough and therapy and antidepressants definitely help with that but I m so scared that I will ruin everything again    amp  x   B   I m sorry guys this was a long one  Thank you whoever read all of this and please don t hate me because of my selfish behaviour  I really try to change but I think I need some help 
212,0,Have I    f  been ignoring red flags about my boyfriend    m  I m sorry if this is too long  I m trying to give as much context as possible  Also  I m on mobile    My boyfriend and I have been dating seriously for about one year  I love him very much  he s an amazing person  but sometimes I feel very insecure about our relationship and I think he gives me reasons to feel like that    We met on tinder like     years ago  We had a very intense   month period of not knowing what our relationship status was  which included me opening up about being in love with him and him admitting that while he loved me  he wasn t in love with me  After many fights  we had a final big one  said some ugly things to each other and completely stopped talking for around   months  After the   months  we made up and then had a serious talk and I was completely honest about what I wanted  I told him that I didn t want to keep having sex without being in a committed relationship and he understood and said that was fair  We agreed that we would be seeing each other exclusively  but never really said that we were boyfriend and girlfriend  I honestly wasn t too worried  as I was just happy to have him in my life again without all the fighting    Since then we ve been going strong  We go out on dates  we spend weekends together  I go watch his concerts  he studies music   he knows most of my friends  and most people know I have a boyfriend  He has also supported me through some really rough times  not only emotionally  but financially too  I ve also managed to help him open up about his relationship with his parents and other frustrations    Now let s get to the issues that keep me awake at night      His family doesn t know about our relationship at all  It s important to mention that he has very conservative Indian parents  who believe in arranged marriage and are against interracial dating  I m Latina   He mentioned that he does not want to bring up dating at the moment because he is still in school and he s afraid of them cutting him off financially  To be fair  I mentioned him to my mom right in the beginning  but after she started being invasive about our sex life I stopped telling her anything  so my family doesn t really know we re still together       His friends don t know about me and he makes sure not to give out any signs of the nature of our relationship while we are around them  He says he s not embarrassed of me or anything  but he doesn t have many close friends and he doesn t want people to know too much about his personal life  he is very reserved indeed        I m not allowed in his apartment  He lives with   housemates  and shares the actual room with one of them  He said they don t like when there s strangers in the house  so I ve only been there a few times while his housemates weren t there  I know also that he doesn t like his roommate and often complains about how much time he spends in the room and about having no privacy  I am pretty sure they know he s dating someone though because he spends most weekends at my place       We don t have sex as often  I enjoy sex very much and we are extremely comfortable with each other  but we don t have sex as often as I wish we would  I believe that s because he has been stressing out about school  as I noticed that we tend to have more sex when he seems more relaxed  I have really bad anxiety  he knows that  and constantly doubt myself  so sometimes I worry that it s because he stopped finding me attractive  I try not to pressure him  but I think he notices that it makes me sad and feels guilty about it   And the worst of all     I caught him on Tinder more than once  The first time it happened I didn t say anything for a few days because I was convinced that I was just imagining it  and that he would never be on a dating app while he was with me  Whenever I get upset though  I can t hide it  so he noticed that there was something bothering me and insisted that I should tell him  When I told him what I thought I saw him doing  he didn t try to hide it and said he was using it just because he was bored  I had a meltdown and asked him to delete it because it made me very upset  He said he would get rid of it and we forgot the subject  Then a few weeks ago  I caught him on it again  I immediately said we needed to talk when we got home and he guessed that it was about that  I had another meltdown because I was heartbroken about him being on the app again  He said that he wasn t talking to anyone and that he was just passing time  I got angry because I had asked him to delete it and because I believed that it didn t matter if he was talking to anyone  him being on the app was disrespectful to me  He agreed that he was unfair and apologized for breaking my trust  and promised that this time he would really delete it  I made sure to tell him that there wouldn t be another chance if I caught him doing that again  and I mean it     Now  everything I mentioned bothers me  but I can understand some of it  such as our cultural differences and lack of sex drive while stressed  But I can t stop thinking about the Tinder thing  I feel like it s driving me crazy with suspicion  He did it twice  what s stopping him from doing it again    At the same time  I feel guilty for thinking like that because he is very patient  affectionate  kind  generous and tries to keep me happy  He always makes time for me  he puts my needs first sexually  he always expresses how much he loves me and how great he thinks I am  He s really my best and closest friend  and I think I am his  and I share all my secrets with him  I don t wanna lose him so I ve told him a million times that if he wants to break up with me and be just friends  that s fine  I just don t want him to be with me for some reason other than loving me  He says that he is with me because he truly loves me and wants to make me happy  I try to believe him  but because of my anxiety I m suspicious about people s intentions   Do you guys think I m ignoring red flags  Or is it irrational to feel doubtful 
213,0,Boyfriend started doing drugs and I don t know how to feelNow  I know most would think that marijuana is harmless and I should be okay with him doing it  The thing is  we re young  Think around     I also know that most    year olds these days go around doing a little every now and then  and nobody pays them any mind  When I first met my boyfriend  he was a mysterious guy who seemed like he did edgy  cool things  that s why I started liking him in the first place  really  However  as I found out more about him  I came to understand that he was sweet  smart  compassionate  funny  and above all very loving  Back then  it seemed like he would never even think about going near any drug  and I was super happy about that  Then  we unfortunately had to move to different high schools  me to an expensive private school and him to a public art school  I knew that we would change in high school  for everyone changes in high school  and I thought I was prepared for that  Now  let me clarify that I ve always been a pretty shy and nervous kid  I don t like having a lot of friends  and I was raised to be scared of anything if people told me it was bad  Growing up just a ways away from the downtown area of my city  I witnessed  and smelled  a lot of cigarette and marijuana use as a kid  And man  I was terrified  To this day  I really can t explain why  Throughout my life  I ve avoided anything and everything if it had to do with drugs  This is why I was so happy to have a boyfriend who I thought had the same mindset  Knowing that he was an outgoing  charismatic  and very interesting person  and that he was going to a school where teachers didn t really care about students vaping  smoking  and taking marijuana left and right  I readied myself for the introduction of drugs into my boyfriend s life  However  I just thought he wouldn t be so easily swayed  When school started  me and him would call on the phone every day for a while and tell each other what had happened that day   I noticed immediately that he was meeting a lot of gangsters  and tough kids  but he was also meeting people who he liked  and wanted to be friends with  I didn t really make any friends  About a month into school  two of our friends from our old school  also very innocent and kind children  were inviting us over for a  smoke sesh  at a park  While I immediately declined the offer  my boyfriend accepted it  We didn t talk while he was there  and afterwards he called me very late and told me what a fun time he had  I held back tears as he explained to me what happened  and then I exploded and asked him to promise to never smoke again  The next few months were a nightmare for me and him  He was constantly being offered drugs  and while he always turned them down  I could tell he wanted the good times he had at the park  I felt so bad  yet I knew that if drugs entered our relationship  it would spiral downward and quickly end  Soon  he was doing weed without telling me  because his new friends started doing it  I found out  of course  and I got upset  Again  he promised he d stop  but this time he told me he wasn t sure why he had to stop  A couple months later  I find out he s been smoking marijuana  vaping  smoking cigarettes  and even getting drunk at school off of wine and tequila and rum  every day  At    years old  I got very upset this time  and I felt not only uncomfortable and scared but also useless and for some reason suicidal  I thought that he didn t need me to make him happy  he just needed drugs  drugs  and more drugs  All while he was killing himself  He valued harmful  poisonous drugs that hurt him  more than me  Once again  he apologized and told me this time he d really quit  but this time he added that he wanted to keep doing it  A couple weeks ago  he told me he s been getting high every now and then  I didn t know what to do  or to say  I just want to keep one thing out of our relationship  Just one thing  I felt powerless  useless  like a waste of oxygen  I started feeling suicidal again  and I started practicing self harm for the first time since we got together  He even told me that it d be so easy for him to quit  that it s such a small thing and it doesn t really matter to him at all  However  he s not promising to stop anymore  He wants compromise  He doesn t see why he has to stop doing something just because it makes me upset  I wanted so badly to make him choose between me or the drugs  but I was afraid of what he d pick  and I knew he wouldn t be happy  In the end  all I want is for him to be happy  Lately  this has been all that s on my mind  He s on a  schedule  now  he s only allowed to get high once a week  on the weekends  but as ridiculous as it sounds  it s still tearing me apart  I don t know what to do  or how to feel  I don t have a single friend at school because I m too damn shy to talk to people  and he s the only one I rely on to help me get things off my chest  I don t want something that is so small to him and that also happens to be the one thing I wanted to avoid in this relationship to be the thing that makes us break up  We ve been together a couple years and I really adore this guy  I just want him without the weed  That s all  I don t want to break up with him  I just want him to stop one thing he likes doing  because I m afraid of what I might do to myself if he continues    Tldr  My boyfriend and I went to different schools  and he quickly picked up on doing drugs  I ve always been terrified of the stuff my entire life  and I wanted to keep it out of our relationship  so I made him promise he d stop  but he kept doing it while lying to me  this continued on and on and I started feeling suicidal  lately we ve been fighting and I don t want to break up with him  I just need help
214,0,I   F overdrank  blew up and told my spouse   M  off  A lot built up  Am I the asshole I overdrank and consumed a six pack of beer in less than   hours and became enebriated  I began expressing my fears to my spouse about a pregnancy scare we had  I told him that I felt like he might leave me if I ever got pregnant or suggest an abortion because he doesn t want children  He has suggested in the past that I could get an abortion to get rid of a baby  but that suggestion just pisses me off honestly   He became offended and said that I didn t give him credit in our marriage  but  an abortion was an option  and that made me feel worse    In the past months I have taken a lot of responsibility    I clean the house alone most of the time and he won t bother to clean up trash he leaves behind on a daily basis    I brought that up  I am tired of being the only one that gives a shit    He then began to put me down for drinking so much  and while I was embarrassed   I brought up that he CONSTANTLY smokes weed all day for his depression    I am the only one with a job  I clean the house  baby him and try my best to keep everything together    So wtf can t I drink a   pack on my off day and GET FUCKING MAD about the state of our lives if I want to   He then began to record me and give me the silent treatment   In the past few months  he blew up on me and told me I was garbage and he regreted our marriage and that I should kill myself  That still is on my mind  so why would I think he truly cares about me    Am I the asshole    amp  x   B 
215,0,Son   M  no longer wants his babysitter    F  because her son   M  has special needsI am at a loss of how to navigate this   Betsy has been a good babysitter   She picks my son Ryan up from the bus stop every day and takes care of him for a couple hours until my husband gets home from work   She s pretty reliable and she tries to not just keep Ryan alive but also entertained    Ie  sledding in winter  the park in summer     Betsy has a son  Adam  with special needs   Adam isn t dumb at all  he reads above his grade level  for example   But he has some serious speech issues and he is on the spectrum   There may be other issues but I m not fully aware of them   He s a sweet kid     At first  Ryan and Adam were two peas in a pod   Then they became like brothers  both playing and fighting   Now Ryan doesn t want to be around Adam anymore   He said that Adam is sometimes physical with him  like hitting    I spoke with Betsy about it and she said she hadn t witnessed it but she would pay extra attention   She got really worried that I was mad at her  I wasn t  and mentioned to my husband that she questioned Adam and he said he never hit Ryan  and he started crying saying that he loves Ryan   Since that talk  Ryan hasn t reported any hitting  so I assume Betsy is closely watching    But he is still saying he would miss Betsy but he wants another baby sitter because he wants someone who can  speak to  him  normally  and who doesn t have special needs   To be clear  Ryan does NOT ever pick on Adam for these issues   He has only spoken to me about how he feels    I feel terrible and don t know what to do   I don t want to fire Betsy because of her son   I don t want my son to be unhappy   I can t blame a   year old for wanting a friend without special needs  but I feel like total shit for even considering finding a new babysitter over this   I need to figure out what to do and how to navigate 
216,0,I  F    cannot stand the fact that my boyfriend  M    is sleeping in the same room with other girlsOk there are a lot of things to say about this story but I will try to keep it as short as possible    It all started   days ago  My boyfriend is    years old and is really fond of a specific thing  Self development trainings  In fact we met in one of those  And although I like them too  I am not gonna lie  I don t want to spend my life doing them    So we ve been together for more than half a year and he arranged to go on one of these things again now  At this point I want to mention that we live in different countries and we are meeting once a month for like     days  I knew long before that he would go to this training but what I didn t know is that this thing is for       days   When I found out I felt really bad  I told him that he has never visited me for   days straight because of work and it feels really unfair to me  He told me that this is different and he told me that in case I wanted to meet more often he would help me go to him by paying my tickets etc  But that s not an option as I am studying still    Anyway I was really cold for   days and to be honest he was talking to me really nicely and supportive but it just doesn t feel right for me to say nice stuff to him  We have been fighting everyday also as I am really disappointed he s going there    During our fights  I asked him one thing  I didn t want him to sleep in the same room with girls  I know that in those places hippies are really common and I told him I wouldn t feel comfortable if he did that  Today he was complaining to me about being still cold and I just told him it doesn t feel right for me to tell him smth  After that I asked him if he s alone in the room  He was trying to delay answering but finally he told me that he is in the room with two girls and one guy  I got really pissed and he told me maybe he needs someone that is more a grown up than me and hanged up   I tried to state the facts as objective as possible  I will just add that what is breaking my heart is that he prefers being there   days instead of being with me  And that he didn t even respect what I asked him not to do    Am I just unreasonable or is this thing going to shit  
217,0,How to deal with breakupSo me    f  and my Bf    m  of   years are probably gonna breakup   It s my first ever serious relationship Lil background   my Bf always dreams about a relocation to another country  even before he met me  Actually the year we started to date he was supposed to move  But things developed very beautifully and fast  After    months  we moved to live together  everything was great he is the best partner in the world  I can say with my full honest heart that he is the guy I ve been dreaming about  our relationship is so pure and honest  we are best friends  We really thought we d end up married with kids and even talked about it several times   The thing is he s currently studying a profession  he has his goals and dreams set up  But me  I feel lost  I m still constantly trying to find myself and my purpose in life  So it is very stressful when he tells me he s not gonna live or wait for me more than   years  Simply because he can t see himself in this country  for something that isn t sure  I want to add that we moved back to our parents and this one is ON Me  I decided I want to move back to my folks cuz I can t study and work for an apartment simultaneously  and I want to deduct myself for my future career  for us both so we can have a stedee life and won t worry about money   I am very determined that I want a career before I even think about children  simply cuz I know how hard it is to raise kids without a financial base   From his side  he wants me to move with him  he says he loves me but I find it difficult to belive because in this situation he s not willing to sacrifice anything for this relationship to last  and it s a lot of pressure because I need to want to move with him  I need to leave my family behind  I need to find an easy career  as he offered me  just for it to be easier to satisfy my will for a career    I feel like he is the one  but we met at the wrong time   It is so frustrating to see how beautiful and pure our love  and its being destroyed because no one would compromise    I understand that he s a whole person with wills and dreams and I support him and am happy for him to have that in his life   Cannot fade the felling  it hurts so much   I love him so much he s the better half of me and I ll always love him in my heart  In my optimistic phase now I believe we are like Robin and barney  our love story won t end  But I guess im naive   We haven t broke up officially but I feel the end    I guess time will do its magic but how do you deal with the memories and the little moments that meant the world to you  How do you stop being best friends  Wtf should I do  Simply wanted to share and take it off my chest    Want to apologise for mistakes  English isn t my first language    Thank you so much for reading this  I appreciate it   If you ve been dealing with the same thing share with me your way of dealing with it    
218,0,My girlfriend and I broke up due to a bad situation  but since the we ve been having trouble restraining ourselves from essentially acting like a couple  Should we get back together or stay apart My ex boyfriend     m  and i     f  broke up recently  not because we weren t doing well together  but because of our situation  Both of us are students  and we both have a variety of mental health issues  Our relationship actually stemmed from us helping each other with said issues  although it has grown into so much more    We broke up because we were constantly talking and doing things together preventing us from having our old conversations of the sort  and our grades were suffering as a result of our lack of restraint  At the same time  our friends were being really mean about us dating  we were already friends with a friend group before we dated   The words of a few specific friends began to degrade both our mental healths  We decided it would be best for us to end it  at least for now  So we did   However  we still kept talking almost every day because we were still really close friends  and we were both having trouble holding back  calling each other cute and occasionally beginning to be sexual before we caught ourselves    If we were to go back to dating  we would definitely work more on restraint and not as much distracting each other during things that need to get done   Is it better to stay apart and attempt to restrain ourselves better  Or just say  screw it  and be together anyway   Thoughts 
219,0,Boyfriend    M  used to leave computer unlocked but now purposefully locked it after I    F  asked to use it We ve been together a year  He has his computer in his room and I m in his room alone sometimes since he leaves for work early  I ve went to use his computer before when I ve needed to for college classes and it was always unlocked   He has always used his computer as an alarm clock because he sleeps through his phone ones  plus to turn off the alarm on the computer you have to physically get up   So i asked him to set one for the morning for me since i had to get up way earlier than usual  He said yes  but then said i may have to just press the mute button on his keyboard   Incase he accidentally locks the computer     That sounded really odd to me because he wouldn t accidentally lock it he would have to lock it himself and it has been unlocked every time i have had to use it before

221,0,My    M  girlfriend    F  broke up with me three weeks ago I would appreciate a lot your opinions and advices about what should I do  thanks in advance  and sorry for the mistakes  English is not my language    First of all  I have to say that this was our first serious relationship for both of us  so we don t have experience  It all began in New year s night of       that night Tracy  not her real name  and I met  and after an all night long conversation I really felt something special for her  two days after I asked Tracy if she would like to go to take a beer  and she said yes  So we had planned to met only for a few hours  but ended chatting like   hours about all kind of stuff  After this I knew for sure that this girl could be someone very special for me  The thing is that after a few weeks talking with Tracy  her best friend Lily  again  not a real name  told me that even when at the beginning Tracy felt something romantic for me  she doesn t felt it anymore  but Tracy really wanted us to be friends  This was hard  but things like this happens    So the next   months we started to hang out in the same group of friends  and everything was right  I have moved on and there was no expectation from me to be something more than just friends  anyway in those months we never stop chatting daily  and we become good friends  Then  in the last month of summer  she proposed me a couple of times to met her alone to do things like go to the cinema or go get a drink  but the reality is that I never suspected that she would have any interest about be something more than just friends  Later  at a party in the last week of summer  Tracy kissed me and said that she was sorry for rejecting me months ago because she was not sure about her feelings and didn t want to hurt me  The next week we met again and I told her that if she was looking for something serious we could continue seeing each other and see how it goes  she agreed and confessed me that she and her best friend Lily had feelings for me  so the relationship didn t gonna be something easy for her    Weeks passed and Tracy and her best friend Lily stopped talking to each other and Tracy opted to stop hanging with our group of friends  and thinking about that now I suppose that didn t should be easy for her    This month we were like   months dating    really great months  we have never argued about anything nor had any problem  the only thing strange is that in this time we didn t have had sex  anytime I talked about this she said that she was kinda embarrassed about doing it  but well nothing serious I thought  also I preferred to wait until we can make it special and don t do it in a car or something like that    Three weeks ago we talked about it  and agreed to book a hotel room  so we can be alone and calm  A few days later I asked again if everything about us was going well because  I wanted to be sure that she really wanted to do it  so I asked Tracy this saying that I really like her  and she said that all was great and then kissed me  yes  she didn t say that she likes me  but I didn t give that too much attention at that moment   So the thing is that after that night  she almost stopped chatting with me with no apparent reason and five days later we met up  and she said that in the last week she realized that she doesn t feel the same that she felt for me  and then she broke up  In the broke up she seemed very affected and I have to say that she was kinda stressed with her collage exams and finding a job  so she could be independent of her parents   So  my question is  should I give her more time and space to reconsider it or should I gave up on her and move on  Thanks for your help  
222,0,My girlfriend  F    forgot my birthday  M    and is upset with me    Months To start this off  I don t want to just be critical over her forgetting  Me and her have been together for around   months  My birthday just came around and she forgot which honestly I was a little upset about  I had mentioned it earlier in the month that is was coming up but she can be forgetful  I confronted her about it and said I was upset and wanted her to apologize for forgetting  She said I didn t talk about it and that she s forgetful but apologized after a few minutes  Later in the day I thought about what happened and realized I could have made the same mistake in her position as I also can tend to be forgetful  I texted her saying I was sorry and didn t mean to make her feel uncomfortable if I did  She read the text this morning and when I asked what she thought she didn t look at me and just said  time   Really stressed about this  any advice would be appreciated  I still care about this girl a lot but I have no idea what s going on 
223,0,Would you buy love My boyfriend and I were good friends for   years before dating  In the beginning of our relationship he treated me so good and I fell in love   However  months later he would say he s leaving me because of something ridiculous and the only way he would stay is if I bought him something  We were together    months and in total I spent about   k on him  He ended up leaving me and took everything I had to buy him  Would you stay in a relationship even if you were in love

225,0,My Best Friend  F    Used Me  M    as a Break From Her Boyfriend  M    and Im HeartbrokenOk  this may be rambling and if this isnt the appropriate place for thise please let me know and feel free to take it down  Alot of background is need for this to make sense  This whole situation revolves around my best friend  F     myself       and her currrently ex boyfriend          I met my best friend last March at a party and we instantly clicked  We hooked up several times and went on many dates  However because of the end of the semester rapidly approaching we agreed to keep in touch over the summer and look at a serious relationship when the fall semester rolled around  Just for reference we live   hours apart    Over the summer I made multiple trips to see her and she several to see me  I thought everything was great until about a week before classes were slated to start again  At this point she got distant and stopped talking to me as much  I was a bit confused and asked her what was going on  She explain she had been texting another guy all summer and that she wanted to date him not me    Ill admit I was bummed out and felt led on a little but hey  we are young and at this point she and I are already very close and friendly  So she starts dating the afore mentioned dude but   and a half months in she and I were hanging out and one thing led to another and we ended up cheating on her boyfriend together  For several weeks  This came to a stop when I told her that she needed to either break up with him and commit to me  I still had feelings for her  or we needed to stop being around each other  She decided to tell the guy   The dude was devastated but said he would never ask her to stop talking to her best friend and wanted to work through it  She told me she wanted to end things but that the guy kept crying or begged her to stay or bought her expensive things to get her to stay every time she tried to emd things with him  So she stayed  For several more months until Valentine s day of this year     They had an argument and she broke up with him  Then came to me for emotional support  Which I was happy to provide  About a week after she broke up with him she confessed to me that she had feelings for me and that she really cared for me and wanted to pursue something more with me  Something I should say now is that I am in love with her  I welcomed her with open arms and she all but moves in with me  We make a trip to visit my family over spring break  this was the first time she had met them  and we do everything together  Sunday night as we laid in bed she told me that the way I love and the way I care for her is unlike any other guy she has been with and that it is amazing and exactly what she wants  Then yesterday happened   Out of no where she tells me that she spoke with him yesterday  that she loves him  and that she never liked me the way she likes him  Then she tells me that I have to decided if I can be her friend or if she needs to remove herself from my life   I dont know what to do  Im heart broken  This is my best friend and a girl who to me I thought was perfect and she claimed to feel the same for me  Now she is pulling away from me wholly and has given me an ultimatum of either being her friend and supporting her while she pursues the other dude or giving up the person who has been my best friend for the better part of a year  When ever I try to talk to her about this if I mention being sad she accuses me of trying to get pity  Which hurts even more because I just want to understand what is going on  She claimes she has loved him the entire time she and I were together but didnt want to tell me because I am a manic depressive and she claims she didnt want to hurt my feelings   All along she has told me that she and I just click on a level she has never connected with anyone else before  She told me she wanted to build a solid relationship and that she really liked and wanted to be with me  I just dont understand   There are alot of little things im leaving out  She has her flaws but I look past them because she means the world to me  Even as a friend  But right now I feel alone  used  and hollow  I want to be mad and push her away and be done with her  but Im not emotionally or mentally strong enough to do that      Im desperate for help and any advice  I can do my best to answer questions because I know this might have been hard to read  im on mobile and a bit of a wreck right now  Thanks  friends  hope it is ok for me to call y all that     Edit  Hey  sorry for the late response im just waking up  Rather than respond to you guys individually  since you are all on the same page  I figured I would just add this edit  I think mentally I know you are all right  she had hurt me and I need to have a little more self worth than to continue calling myself her friend  I think what is holding me back is that I just dont want the additio al pain of removing her from my life  But Im gonna take your advice  Im not really one for removing people from my life with zero explination  so im gonna talk to her today and be done with her  Thank you  I guess I need the support

228,0,What do I do Im in a bit of a pickle and I dont know what to do  it probably seems obvious but i could use some advice      I  M  met this girl a just over a year ago  and we sort of instantly clicked  Playful banter  fun times  good laughs and a little flirty  I had a crush from get go really  but I sort of kept it quiet because I never in a million years thought she would be into me   Some time passes and we agreed to go for a drink  as nothing but friends   I was a bit drunk by the end of it and made a move that she rejected  Feeling crappy  I realised that she d never really feel that way and that I should give up on my highschool crush  which I did  This was all good and well until a few weeks later  I went out and had had a lot to drunk  in an innocent attempt to keep my night going I called this girl and I ended up going to the get together she was at  By the end of the night  we were all tired and so everyone went to bed and we ended up in the same bed  This night she ended up making a move on me and we slept together  This just utterly confused me  she rejected me  then we sleep together    regardless I couldnt help my feelings  I had a crush again  a little stronger this time  Just to confuse me even more I was ignored for the next few months after that   After that time has past  I was sleeping and woke up to a phone call from  you guessed it  I went to picked her up  drunk a bit sloppy  she started talking to me about everything that she missed talking to me about in that time that she ignored me whilst driving her home  Side note  I am also in a relationship with someone else at this time  After a while of catch ups  she turns the subject around to say that she had always had feelings for me and just had too many issues at home  with friends and with committing that she didnt want to build our friendship any further  She told me a whole bunch of small things she did that she wouldnt just do over any guy  This was super confusing for me but I was really happy to hear it  Despite the fact that I relationship  I decided to take the chance with her  I also just wanted to add that I accept full responsibility for cheating on my partner at the time  This made me realise that I was only in that relationship because it was comfortable  not because I truly loved my partner at the time  After this I wanted to flesh things out so we talked about it later and she decided that she wasnt able to commit to me didnt want a relationship  I accepted that and she ignored me for another few months   Now we are seeing each other again  with school and all  and I realised that what she told me that one drunken night had really stuck this time  Although just the other week she told me she was in a relationship with someone else    I told her how I felt on that night but I have not expressed any of my feelings towards her because I m afraid of losing her as a friend  Im feeling really frustrated and angry  I dont know what to do  I asked to have some space but I need help in getting over this crush    im also scared that if I get over it this time I wont feel the same towards her again    Am I just in feeling like this  Any advice  
229,0,My    F  boyfriend    M  wants to teach our future children Chinese  I do not speak Chinese  What should we do I    F  am Japanese  born and raised in the United States  English is my mother tongue  so I don t speak Japanese fluently because of this  However  I am currently learning Japanese  along with Spanish due to how common it is spoken in my state  better job opportunities   and I had to take it anyway for school  I am also in university    My boyfriend    M  on the other hand  was born and raised in a traditional Chinese family  so his native language is Chinese  and learned English from video games and school   We love each other very much and we both like to express our Asian heritage with one another  It makes me happy that he is proud of his identity   he has a Chinese name and does not want to take up an English name    Recently  he brought up the subject of having kids  He asked me if we ever had kids if he could teach them Chinese    Now  I know several children grow up bilingual  In our case  said kids would grow up speaking Chinese and English  The problem is that I do not speak Chinese  and even before I met him  I was always too intimidated to attempt speaking Chinese due to its difficulty  I have lots of Chinese friends who speak Chinese  or are trying to learn it  and even the ones growing up admit that it s a hard language because of its tones  etc  I am also learning two other languages and even that is a lot    I responded with   But I don t speak Chinese   And he said he would teach me  Although  generally speaking  you can t really teach your native language  at least  not very well  You grew up speaking it  so it comes naturally to you and you don t think about the grammar rules  or any of that    I don t really take issue with the idea as a whole  because I would ve loved to grow up bilingual too  There are several benefits  not to mention Chinese is among the most widely spoken languages in the world  It s simply that I do not speak it  and I don t exactly have the time to learn it  But his Chinese background means a lot to him  and he wants to pass it down to his children  That being said  culture slowly dies out every generation  at least in my family it did    What should we do  I would appreciate different perspectives and insight    TLDR  I m Japanese  boyfriend is Chinese  he wants to teach our future kids Chinese  but issue is  I don t speak Chinese    edit  Thanks all for your opinions  Some posts thought that I wasn t going to let him do it  or asked why I think it s such a big problem  So to be clear  I wasn t opposed to the idea to begin with  I was just unsure because I wasn t sure how it would work if they spoke it when I didn t  hence why I am posting here now   Maybe I am overthinking that part too much  oh well  And I get that it would be an excellent skill in their lives  so I will encourage the multilingual ness we have going on here  haha

238,0,My    F  boyfriend s    M  mum    F  keeps text messaging my dad when her and her son have an argument  I ve been NC with his whole family for   yearsI called my dad yesterday and he told me my bf s mum messaged him  which is crazy because my dad changes his mobile number very often and how did she manage to get it   Bf doesn t have it either  and I had to change my number because she kept harassing me    She told my dad that my bf is cheating on me and sent a multi media message as well  but because my dad uses an old phone he can t receive it  It s most likely a photo    This isn t the first time she has contacted my dad or my family  she s called my younger sister  she s called both my brothers as well in the past    Her reasoning is that apparently I involve her in our relationship issues  which doesn t make sense because I ve been no contact for about   years  And if we do have issues  it s resolved between us    I think it s time to ditch this   year old tumor  the relationship  because it s just not working      
239,0,I     f  feel as though my boyfriend     m  isn t serious about our relationship My bf and I have been together for   yrs now  I have   children from a previous relationship where he has none  I m ready for the next stage in our relationship  whether it s engagement or at least living together    He refuses to rent an apartment  because he wants to own a home which I understand  He says that when he gets a home  I can live with him but my name wouldn t be on the mortgage  Im not a fan of this option because if it doesn t work out  I pretty much would have helped him pay his mortgage and I m left with nothing   I suggest we get a home with both our names  and income  but he says no  he won t do that if we aren t married or engaged  Yet  he tells me constantly he isn t ready for marriage yet   So what the hell do I do  He s ok with living together if my name isn t on the paperwork but if it is  then it s needs to have marriage involved  He also wants kids but I told him my  cut off  age is    and I need to be married before I have another one   Other kids were out of wedlock  not trying to be a single mom of another child    Am I going crazy  Or over thinking this  
240,0,Advice to help my recovering addict friend stay cleanHopefully this is the appropriate sub for this question  As the title suggests  I have a friend that is struggling with a meth addiction    She is doing AMAZINGLY and hasn t used for   months  but tonight the addiction was biting hard  I was picking her up from the pub and she asked me to stop in on the way home to get some drugs  I refused  I talked about how shit she would feel the next day  how mad she would be at herself  Fortunately her dealer wasn t able to deliver  I stayed with her for a bit  before leaving her on the couch watching tv and  hopefully  about to fall asleep    My question is  other that reminding her of her regrets when she has lapsed in the past  does anyone have any additional advice I can use for next time    Her resolve is certainly weakened when she drinks  but honestly the likelihood that she will ever stop drinking completely is practically nil  And I don t want to become that nagging friend either

243,0,  M  only had a short relationship before this one  In need of advice on how to control my insecurity and anxiety of fucking upI m actually in a very similar position as I was last year with my first relationship  befriend people in college  hang out  develop feelings  We can be together for hours and hours at the campus  usually with a bunch of friends  but we do find our alone time  also she lives nearby so we can spend the afternoon at her place before I go home   I think it s a really cool dynamic sharing so much time and all the friends  but it gets weird when all of sudden we re apart for   days  weekend   free day   The  problem  is that I don t even take public transport  it s a private bus on a contract and a    minutes commute  fixed times  Like  we can t just go on a date Saturday night and then go home     So back to my last year s date  she was a bit demanding  Wanted my to text her good night every single day  and reach out in the weekends but it was a bit weird because she herself rarely initiated  This new girl needs much much less attention  We ve been just good friends to each other  like I am with many other people  I don t feel the pressure of a  commited relationship  as I did last year and it s AMAZING  But it s also giving me anxiety and why I m writing this giant essay  I rarely text people out of the blue  certainly never to  chat   I won t hesitate in sending a meme or a photo of the cool thing I just saw  but that situation rarely arises  I m not afraid of losing her or anything like that  but giving the impression of being uninterested  It s all my in stupid head  isn t it  Like I m just overreacting to the other girl I dated 
244,0,Me   m  and Girlfriend   m  committed to a diet  she lied about sticking to itMy GF and I have been together for about   years  I ve always tried to get her to be more active and I myself have struggled as well  I m overweight BMI and she s obese BMI  so I started doing keto as a couple to get us both to be back in shape    amp  x   B   I ve been losing weight over the past   months although keto didn t work out for us  but she s gained about     So I thought it d be a good idea to get us back on keto  She admitted to me that she just ate whatever she wanted while I wasn t around last time we did keto     amp  x   B   Last time we did keto  I cooked a lot of the meals  explained everything to her and set her up with a MyFitnessPal log  I told her how to count her calories and worked really hard to educate her  I felt exhausted keeping up with her on it  and she told me the entire   months we did it that she was loyal to it  It was all a lie  and I feel super betrayed  Now I m thinking of her as someone who can t really stick to anything and won t be honest about anything  If she s so happy to lie about that stuff why should I trust her at all     amp  x   B   I m concerned about what I should do now  I expressed to her that this level of lying isn t the first time she s done things like this and that I don t feel like the relationship will work out  It sucks because we live in a house together now and we re sort of intertwined  
245,0,He has an internet sex addiction SOSMy fianc  and I have been together     years  to be married in   months  We ve had a rocky road  Early on we started fighting  We both have a lot of issues  I suffer from PTSD and I struggle with severe insecurities in myself and anger trust towards men from past relationships  He was abused as a kid for a short while which led him into a full blown intense porn addiction for       years  When I met him  I told him I can t handle that  We re Christian  we don t stand for that  But he continued some of those behaviors  Early on in the relationship he had a stash of his ex girlfriends naked pictures  he claims he deleted and rarely looked at  but I didn t find this out until well over a year later  He stares at women every chance he gets  feeling tempted to stare at just about anyone with tight clothing or athletic wear  He and I both agreed he has a sex addiction that needs treatment  He has sought treatment through group therapy  counseling  you name it  But the worst part about all of this is he lies about it  nearly every time  He doesn t lie about anything else  that I know of  just always anything related to this subject  Our trust has been broken because of that more times than I can count  So we put a filter on his phone so he can t watch porn  But he has found loopholes  desperate loopholes  He started looking up lingerie on an eBay app just to look at women  dug out some health magazines when I wasn t home  etc  He claims he doesn t get turned on by this stuff but it s like  looking at a nice car  and it s a stress relief he says  But to me it s objectifying women and degrading them  It also hits home for me because our sex life has been pretty bad since I stopped birth control over a year ago and we re using protection now  But most recently I found out he was googling some innocent words that led to scandalous ads popping up  and doing that repeatedly for his fix in a way I won t find out  He also was using a freaking Fitbit app to creep on the groups section at any women posting progress pictures so he could see their workout bodies  On a scale of   to run for the hills  how concerned should I be  Am I TOTALLY overreacting here  I am so terrified of calling off our wedding and our marriage  Besides all the drama  we truly do love each other from the bottom of our hearts  We re best friends and we get along in every other department  But we can t seem to get past this one  I am most hurt by the lying  hiding and secrets  But it seems to be the addiction talking  He is motivated to work on this and try something new  He has joined a group of men with sexual addiction that meet every week and hold each other accountable  Says this time is different and he s done living like this  But he says that every time   I hate this problem  I don t know where to go from here  I don t want to give up on him with everything in my heart  I just don t want him to be this way anymore and I have no control over that  There s nothing I hate more than being lied to and no matter how many times we fight over the lying part and I ve made it very clear that s the worst part  he still lies again to protect himself  HELP

250,0,Please Help   Bare with me here   So my younger Sister     years old has had three daughters with a man whom which I ve known many years before they began their relationship  They have been together for about   years now  From my perspective the relationship had its up and downs which seemed somewhat normal for a family that size given their age and maturity  I started to get a red flag when I noticed that he was beginning to control her by keeping her in the house all of time  not supporting her to continue schooling or a career and basically having very insecure trust issues about anything that had or has to have anything to do with her being in public giving her a chance to develop other relationships  As far as I know she has never cheated on him  Very long story short  I just received news that he has been extremely violent towards her and has for what I believe to be the majority of the relationship  A recent fight resulted her getting a black eye  a fat lip  and strangle marks around her neck  two of the little girls witnessed it  She didn t call the police but once we found out the story and that she had photos of her bruised face we had him arrested promptly  This has been going on for a while like I said  There are more and more stories coming out of her that are completely horrific  Now then  the other factors of this story is that we lost our Mother to suicide about   years ago and the healing process has been terribly difficult  So in the midst of depression and domestic abuse my Sister had developed a drug abuse problem and started getting pills  his money   Subutex and pain pills I believe  So she went to rehab a few months ago and has done pretty well from what I understand  I would like to add that she got abused once she got home from rehab from an insecurity that she cheated on him while in the program    She is filing a BPO tomorrow and considering doing a temporary custody release so she can get back on her feet      I call her a bunch  i m out of state right now  and make sure she knows that I will do whatever it takes to help as much as possible  i just don t know exactly what to do considering she cant get another apartment tomorrow because she hasn t had a job since they ve been together and been completely codependent  Also considering he will get bailed out soon by his Dad that has a past of vilence as well  I need advice on what she needs to get involved with to heal herself from her abusive relationship and dealing with our deceased Mother and other things she can do to start moving forward  I almost want to overload her with options  facts  and solutions  If you have any more questions feel free to ask and my apologies if this story is a bit rampant  I could go into more detail but i m not in the best mindset to write a novel right now  Thank you all

254,0,How should I date a recovering alcoholic I really like this guy  We ve been on a few dates  He s amazing  He s caring and sweet  He has a good job  Responsible  Awesome baseball player  I admire him for many  many reasons   So the first time we went out we met at this bar and he said he was having just sparkling water and lime or something similar so I asked the waiter if I could get the same thing but he said  nah  why don t you get a beer   So I didn t really make much of it and had a beer   It took me a few dates to notice he never had anything with alcohol in it  but I didn t want to pry  I m not much of a drinker myself and I hate it when people just insist that I have a drink  so I would just casually ask  what are you having   and when he said something like  ginger ale  I would say  same here  but he would always want to change my order because  he wanted me to have a good time   I even started to think   why am I drinking if he isn t   This last time we went out  however  he casually mentioned something about  staying sober  and that he s been doing  other sobriety stuff  as in he s now helping others stay sober and I immediately understood what he meant but didn t say anything  I only said that I think it says a lot about his character   him wanting to help others and sincerely  it s one of the reasons I like him even more   So   does that mean I also never get to drink again to be supportive  I don t know his history with alcohol   drugs and have no idea how to ask him without sounding like an asshole  really  This is the first time I ve met someone in this position and I by no means want to sound intrusive or hurt his feelings with my stupid questions  can you have a glass of wine  so no alcohol at all as no thing   because I think I do have all sorts of stupid questions   so if anybody could please help me understand the situation so that eventually  and if our relationship progresses   which I m hoping it does  I don t make a total mess out of it  please     
255,0,My    M  girlfriend    F  expressed doubts about our relationship and it s making me anxiousI have been dating a colleague of mine for almost half a year now  She is wise  gorgeous  funny  and we click on a lot of things   However  about two weeks ago we had a big argument that led to a temporary breakup  She needed more openness and emotional connection from me  It is one the things she finds absolutely necessary in a relationship    Truth be told  I have a hard time being open  to people  It takes a while before I really open up   this largely is a defense mechanism from harm   By throwing up this wall  I kept ill emotions at bay  but also made me less in touch with them  Last summer I already came to this conclusion  but due to circumstances  I have only recently been able to find professional help   After the breakup  we had a very raw open conversation  It really felt like we rounded a corner emotionally  So we decided to give it another chance  I want to make this change because it is affecting me and my relationships   I need to start living more   We are two weeks into this and it seemed to be going well  Except for this week  Yesterday we talked on the phone  when she expressed that she still has a feeling of doubt   fair enough  it has only been two weeks   Nevertheless  this still hurts    I am anxious about this and have said so  It feels like I am losing her again  What do I do

257,0,I     m  am a married cop developing feeling for a married paralegal      F  in the District Attorney s Office Throwaway for really obvious and extremely cautious reasons   Background  I m a law enforcement officer in a relatively small county in the US  We are scheduled for court one day every month to testify in traffic DWI cases  Usually we are called by the DA s office on our court dates if we need to come in  Our county is small enough that I may not have to come in  and can stay out on the road working    There begins my problem  A particular paralegal at the DA s office s job is to be in court everyday and call us in if needed  I ll call her Jill  Jill is a problem for me  We are close to the same age  mid   s  and she is extremely attractive  She also has what I would call a naturally flirty personality  I can t think of the word for it but she also keeps up with people I guess  Like if I mention that I m going out of town for the weekend or something  the next time we see each other she ll ask me about it  even if it s a month later  It s not me exclusively  she does it with everyone  She s friends with everyone  I mean friendly  funny  and seems like she genuinely cares about every person she talks to  We are friends on Facebook  she s friends with most of the law enforcement in the county  and it s the same there  Commenting on things  liking them  Sometimes I ll post something hoping she ll like it or I ll have to stop myself from liking everything I see her post  I find myself stopping in to court on my court day before I m called to  check in  but really to see her  I ve even stopped by the DA s office on non court days to talk to an ADA in person about something I easily could have called about  hoping to see her   It s probably a good time to mention that we are both married  My wife and I have been married for   almost   years  I think Jill has been married a year  Maybe less  I do love my wife deeply  She is an amazing woman and I love coming home to her  When I m with my wife I really don t think about Jill  It s when I m working or alone  My wife has seen Jill s comments on things I ve posted or one of my coworkers and has asked me who she was  I told her she was the liaison at the DA s office and my wife didn t ask anything else about her  She s just another work friend as far as she knows  I m not entirely sure what to do  I can t cut contact because of the work thing  We have to talk to each other to do our jobs  I can t transfer to another county  it s a pain in the ass to do and honestly I really love the county I m in and the guys I work with  I ve been in bad counties before and this one is all around pretty damn good  I love my job  But I can t stop thinking about Jill  I ve actually found myself fantasizing about an affair  Not even sexual things but like going out to dinner  or on vacation  It s not like I just think about screwing her but I ve actually thought more about what a relationship would be like with her  I ve never acted on any of these things  She has no idea I feel this way and I really don t what to put her in an awkward situation  I m sure that this is entirely one sided too  She makes a point to talk to me when she sees me  even if we weren t expecting to see each other  but I m sure she does it with all of us     I just don t know what to do  I don t have any one I could bring this up to  I can t figure out how to work out in my head not to continue develop feelings for her  I feel like a high schooler with a crush     TLDR  Crushing hard on a woman I work with minimally  We re both married to other people  Not sure how to cope  
258,0,I ve m    fallen in love with my best friend f    So I think I m in love with my best friend  and I don t know what to do  I ve talked to her about this sort of thing before  but it was because I was confused where our relationship dynamic was at because people kept asking us if we were dating but there was never anything that happened that explicitly would have made that clear  and she told me she never felt any of that  and that I was just her best guy friend  And at the time i thought that at least it was clear that it was just friendship and it was great just knowing what it was between us  but now about a month or so later  I m realizing that I ve now actually caught feelings  I m pretty sure those feelings don t go two ways  I know people are going to say I need to go no contact but I can t  It s just not at option at a small college and we will be living in the same house next semester and have already signed the lease several months ago  Plus she is my best friend and I absolutely don t want to lose her friendship  Just need some advice  and needed to get these thoughts out of my head after a rough day  
259,0,I    M  can t stand seeing my wifes    W  familyHi Reddit   I have quite a bit of trouble with this  so let me explain  please    amp  x   B   Me and my wife are quite different  She is the talkative  extroverted girl  I am the more introverted perfectionist guy  I think a lot about everything  she just decides  I try to get deeper in topics  do research  am currently studying CS  She likes the practical approach and works a job since the end of her school time   However  I really like her  I like our differences  That s why I decided to marry her  I think for her its the same       I have a lot of discussions with her  Also about the things I write here  However we are couple and we find solutions  We are having compromises to each other    amp  x   B   The problem I have is with her family  I can t talk to them the same way I can with my wife   They are very   simple  people  I mean that in no means offensive  They just don t think very much outside their box  They live their little life in their village  have their fights with people they like and they don t  watch their drama soaps  etc   I feel really lost in this environment  I like to have a  wider  look at things  I try to live responsible to others and the environment  I really like to go to the longterm solution  They are  instead  very focussed on short term things    amp  x   B   One big problem I have is   They prefer to buy cheep food  whereas for me it s very important to buy good quality food from companies with an ecological perspective   This really bugs me  They don t really understand my perspective for living healthy and supporting the environment  So whenever I am there I kinda get laughed at because of my decissions to eat salad or don t drink alcohol or not eating meat   I also get strange looks when I do buy my stuff    amp  x   B    amp  x   B   We live about   hours away from them  But for my wife her parents and sisters  she has a twin and a little younger sister  are very important  That means we HAVE to go to every birthday  including parents  sisters  uncle  aunt  grandmas and grandpas   Which means we are around       times a year at her place for atleast a night     amp  x   B    amp  x   B   So whenever me and my wife argue about going to her parents I really feel bad in my stomach  I really DON T want to go there  I kinda hate it   However I know  that for her it s super important  She kinda needs this  So she gets angry  because it seems I don t like her family  Which is only half true  I don t care about them  but I really don t want to be around them or interact with them    amp  x   B   She doesn t like going home alone  Than she feels like she is cheating on me  Also her family is then curious if I just don t like them  which makes me feel bad  I mean they are nice people and all  but I just can t stand them very long   I am really worried  how this thing with her family goes on when we will have kids  I don t want them to be influenced by this family    amp  x   B   So what s your opinion on this one  How should I cope with this   Thanks for reading anyway   
260,0,Me    F  and my boyfriend    M  are in an open relationship but I m starting to regret it  This is a throw away account because my bf follows my other account   Me and my boyfriend have been dating for yeaaars      I have realized through these years I m not comfortable with a lot of sexual things and I m uncomfortable with dirty talk  We both agreed on a open relationship so that if he wants something I m not comfortable with or just wants to dirty talk someone he can go right ahead  I can do the same but I really have no interest   I ve been fine with this until he started talking about his encounters with other people  He always sends me pictures of people he finds attractive  not like famous people like mutuals and such  and talks about how he d like to fuck them or date them   We re both bisexual by the way so it tends to be people of both sexes  He ll ignore me hours on end to talk to these people and only come back to talk about the conversations he had or screenshots of his conversations  He compliments these people like crazy and even talks about doing more domestic things such as cuddling and going on dates with them   which is not what we agreed on   This depresses me to no end because most people he compliments have things I don t  He rarely ever compliments me and he only does when I seem upset  I wasn t jealous or anything when he kept it mostly to himself or when it was just for sexual encounters  Now I feel like he doesn t really like me anymore  like he only likes me because I m here and he doesn t ever really go out to meet anyone else  I ve been to anxious to talk to him about it and I don t even really know how to address my concerns anymore  I feel like sometimes I m just being too jealous or emotional but I m not sure anymore  How should I approach this  If I should even approach it at all    Also didn t know where to put this in  He hasn t had physical sexual encounters with anyone but me  He doesn t have a license and lives with his parents so everything is strictly over the phone or internet right now  I was just mentioning that I don t mind if he did something physical with someone else that I m not comfortable with 
261,0,PLEASE LEND SOME GUIDANCESo I  M    have this consistent fear that my girlfriend      is entertaining other ppl on the side  WHICH I know for a fact isn t the case  I have free access to all her accounts because I have a thumbprint in her phone  Now like I said before I know she s not up to anything  but yet I still take it upon myself to try and find something  It s honestly killing me   this insecurity  It all started from my last relationship where my ex  F    wasn t too fond of the breakup  filled my head with all types of things  one being  I ll never find someone loyal to me again  And for some reason that just stuck and ever since then I ve just been in fear that could be true  but it isn t cause I have found someone who completely is  Then social media doesn t help  constantly seeing videos  posts  whatever of ppl getting it done to them  and how BIG cheating has become  So we ll argue sometimes because I m questioning her from time to time  I just wanna get over my fear  especially knowing she isn t up to anything  What can I do to subside or even conquer this goofy mindset  
262,0,I F    have a problem opening up to people I was molested at a very young age by a close family member and have suffered a lot mentally from it  I visited a therapist who told me I have trust issues because of being abused by someone so close to me  I have a really really hard time opening to my close friends  It makes me feel like I suffer in silence  I feel very lonely and I can t seem to open up to them at all  even though I know they care about me  This is especially hard to open up and it feels like it s affecting my relationship with my boyfriend of   years    M    I m currently not seeing a therapist as I cannot afford it  Any tips 
263,0,Are they not as keen anymore  Short version at the bottom  and using a throwaway with not much details because they re on Reddit a lot too  On phone so sorry for formatting     When me and my partner first got together  we would talk most of the day even if we were busy or working away  They were really attentive and replied to everything I sent  for example if I sent   messages in a row they would reply to both   They were so keen to see me and making plans was really easy    Now when they re away or out I barely hear from them  I feel like I m bothering them whenever I speak to them as I just get really dry replies  No calls or anything either   If they re out they say they won t be on their phone as they re with other people  which is fine  I m not one for  checking in  if someone s out or being controlling   Only problem is that when they re with me  they re glued to their phone and completely blanks me when I m talking due to this    I m always the one who asks them if they re available and it takes them DAYS to get back to me  Sometimes not even acknowledging that I ve asked  When they do tell me they re available it is  I m free right now   We don t live near by each other    I have tried bringing it up but got nowhere    I get most of this would be okay as isolated events  and if they weren t ever chatty and keen to begin with but this is just all the time now and I m not sure what I can do to make it better or why it s happening     I m not overbearing   spammy with messages   controlling  I m generally really chilled out     TL DR   partner used to be chatty and keen to see me but is now the exact opposite and I feel very distant from them  
264,0,My partner    f  said she s getting bored in our relationship and wants to break routineTo clarify  both me and my partner are    and female  We have been together for over a year     months   We live in the US if that s any important   Here s how it went  My girlfriend wanted to Skype me last Sunday night  Sunday was the last day of Spring Break and we hadn t seen each other through all of it because we both were on vacation at different times   When I finally got to Skype her  she told me she had talked to her therapist and came to the realization that she was  bored  with our relationship  I got scared when she said this  but she ensured me that she still loved me  She explained what she meant  She said  when you come over  we always do the exact same thing  It s getting a little redundant   She s right  we do  Usually we ll just curl up in her bed and kiss and snuggle as silly teenagers do  I like doing this and she does too  because we mostly only see each other at school and we don t have a lot of chances to be intimate there   Like I said  it s not that she hates doing it  she s just tired of it because it s the only thing we ever do there  So I proposed that we start doing different things  different date ideas  She liked the idea  and said there were things she wanted to do with me and vice versa  I figured the more were out of one of our houses  the better  We plan to have a picnic this Sunday  if the weather cooperates  I want to get us out  and I want to make her happy   My main questions are these   Is this the right way to go about it  Is there something else we need to do  Any other advice for this   I think I hit every point specifically but I ll clarify more if needed 
265,0,Am I    f  really that needy and naggy to my    m  husband My husband I and I have been married for   years and have a   year old daughter  A reoccurring issue  at least for me  is that I don t think we spend enough time together or that I hardly get his attention  It wasn t always like this but our relationship was very rocky during my pregnancy and when we first had the baby and it hasn t recovered  He frequently tells me I m not here to entertain you  I m too needy  or that If I had a passion I wouldn t feel this way    We recently moved to a new state for his job and were staying with family  This period was hard for all of us but I think it was harder on our relationship more than anything  His job is very demanding and he works very long hours  so he exhausted when he gets home  We were staying in a relatives house and slept in separate beds and then eventually separate rooms but now we have our own place    I try not to bother him as much during the week but sometimes I m too bothered that I cant hold my tongue    For example  The first thing he does when he gets home is says hi to our daughter and gives her hugs and kisses and then walks passed me  He will kiss me if I stop him and pucker my lips    Then he ll spend the remainder of the evening in front of the computer  He ll stop what he s doing if I approach him with something but then go back till he s tired and goes to sleep    He does the same thing on the weekends  When he s not working a crazy schedule he has   day weekends  I often ask him spend time with me or say lets do something as a family  He says no and that he needs all of those days to recover or that he doesn t want to leave the house  which I get  he wants to be relaxed  but sometimes getting him to watch a movie together is difficult     Its not that he doesn t spend time with me at all  its just not frequent enough to me  Like he d be okay if we only did something once every few weeks  I am also a stay at home mom so I know that talking to a toddler all day makes me crave adult attention    Its gotten to a point in our relationship that I am tired of asking and he s tired of hearing about it  He frequently tells me that I don t know what loves is or understand how real relationships work because of my unrealistic expectations  Its completely possible that he s right about this  I ve had shitty relationships in the past and he is the best man I ve ever been with  so maybe I don t understand how healthy relationships function      TL DR   I want more time with my husband but I also want him to want to spend the time with me and not see it as a chore  He works long hours  somewhere between      hrs a day  so I understand that he wants to relax  Am I really that needy and naggy 
266,0,Physical relationship gone wrong  why is this still bothering me    Last year there was this woman Cathy    F   who was in a open relationship  that I    M  talked to on twitter over the years  She wanted to have a physical relationship with me and I said ok  We decided to meet up  When I went to meet her I thought it was going to be her and her cousin outside of a salon they were at  It was her  her cousin and her cousins friends  I was uncomfortable for a while  I didn t like that she didn t tell me that other people were going to be there and I was in the back of the group most of the time other than that it was ok  At the meet I was talking to one of her cousins friends Ana    F  who is single  Cathy suggests that me  Ana and her should have a threesome  Ana says  I just met him   I thought Cathy was joking and Ana changes the topic  Few days after meeting her me and Ana start talking  Cathy asks me if I m interested in Ana I said yes Cathy says  You know I wanna hit that right   I said ok   After that me and Ana go to the movies a couple times  Cathy then asks me out of the blue if we can hookup  We do  and we get intimate  I wore a condom and got tested  Told Cathy I was tested and I m clean   Few days later Cathy texts me upset saying that I betrayed her and that she never wants to have sex with me ever again and at I should  Have fun with Ana    I never spoke to Cathy or Ana after that  What Cathy said stayed with me  I asked my guy friends what I did wrong and they said I didn t do anything wrong that Cathy was just jealous and over reacted  I asked my female friends if what I did was wrong and they said no  but if they were her they d be upset  Why am I still dwelling on this a year later  Did Cathy have feelings for me  Cathy asked if I like Ana and I told her the truth   I told Cathy via Twitter that I was sorry for betraying her  She never responded 
267,0,Help me  us  to healLong story kind of short  me and my s o father of my two youngest broke up last year after being togethers for    I was in a dangerous mental state and he betrayed me by seeing someone else while I was still living with him  raising his kids while he messed around with this despicable c     I believe they started talking while I was in the hospital on a suicide watch  We are now trying to work things out  I m much happier with him than without him  but the trust is completely gone at least on my end  Our sex life is shit  and i have such animosity toward the girl it s like an obsession  During the day the pain is tolerable  but at night I stay up reliving the nightmare and experiencing anger and anxiety and extreme sadness  I do not have the strength nor desire to leave again  I just need words to ease the pain  Thanks
268,0,I    F  absolutely love my boyfriend    M  but don t enjoy having sex with him anymoreWe ve been together for about     years now  he was my flatmate so we have always lived together  At the beginning we used to have sex very often  at one point we reached  x a day  We get along really well and I love him so much  but in the past year I stopped feeling sexual desire towards him  I think he s attractive but when we try to have sex his touch just feels creepy to me  I think I know the reason  actually  This is where it gets a little complicated   I am a bi woman who have lots of LGBT friends and therefore is into that culture  My boyfriend didn t know anything about LGBT culture before but he is super open minded and quickly became friends with all of my LGBT friends  and started to be into that culture as well  watching LGBT TV shows with me  going to gay clubs and drag shows with me and my friends  and now  when alone with me  he often speaks with gay drag lingo and does some of their mannerisms    not at all in a disrespectful way  just for fun because he actually likes it and thinks it s funny   It s really great to have a partner that s as fun and open minded as him but I think I ve started to get creeped out by his touch when we have sex because I now see him as one of my friends  Both of us are not very good at disclosing emotions and talking about our feelings but I ve tried a few times  I once told him to maybe tone that behaviour down and he got a little offended saying that I did it  so why couldn t he  and that he was just being silly  Which is fair enough  I think it s funny and all when my friends do it  but that behaviour it s just not sexually attractive to me  There was one time when we were hanging with his mom and he got drunk and started full on speaking that way and his mom questioned him why he was speaking like that  A lot of people already asked me if he was gay  but I really don t think that s the case  I asked him many times if he had ever felt desire for men and he said no  Even if he was bi I wouldn t mind it at all  He s always trying to initiate something and gets hard really fast so I know he has sexual desire towards me  I think he s just trying to belong in my friends group or something   Another thing that doesn t help the situation is that he is really repetitive and kinda shy during sex and always wants to do the same thing everytime  We discussed this aspect of the problem  I told him what I would like him to do more and he told me what he would like me to do  etc  and it felt like a good discussion  Thing is  that was like   months ago and since then we had sex   or   times only  and with me feeling the same way  creeped out by his touch  I can be horny at the beginning but as soon as he starts touching me I lose my libido  So now I don t feel like having sex with him at all    we haven t had sex in   months  We are always really touchy and hug y but the moment it starts getting sexual it s like it turns a switch inside me  I still have libido and sexual thoughts and feelings  just not for him  I ve been having recurring sex dreams about my ex boyfriend for the last month   I don t really know how to proceed here  He s my best friend  I love him to death  I really enjoy his company  and I think he s very good looking  But thoughts about having sex with other people are starting to pop up and I really don t enjoy having sex with him  I know he would be absolutely crushed if I broke up with him because he s really attached to me  What should I do   TLDR  I really love my boyfriend but don t like having sex with him anymore and am starting to fantasize about having sex with other people 
269,0,Both     m   f  beginning to feel we aren t sexually compatibleTo put this as short as I possibly can  basically my bf has fetishes which don t appeal to me whatsoever  dogging  voyerism  exhibition etc  and honestly i don t want to participate as it doesn t turn me on  I m not confident in myself  he doesn t understand that I don t want to get caught with the risk of being arrested   I m in a job where if I have any offences I won t get hired again     I ve also noticed that we are having sex less often  gone from everyday to once a week  he brought it up by saying  oh I don t make a move on you because you look tired  I tell him it doesn t matter if I m tired or not  even if I initiate for a quickie he just brushes me off   I ve also saw some odd activity his bank statement where he s been spending money on cam sites recently which has made me feel pretty upset because he doesn t spend money on me and it feels no different than paying a prostitute to do stuff for you   I m basically in a dilemma now where I want to leave him but then I don t because he can genuinely be a brilliant guy  but from a sexual point of view I don t feel that I will never be good enough for him and that I m wasting my time   TL DR  We have completely different fetishes  pays cam models behind my back  don t feel that I ll ever be good enough  
270,0,Hard for me to drop her cause i like her but she is confusingIm    M  talking to a women   F    single mother  who basically does not want a relationship right now and wants to be single for awhile but she never told me that personally she posted that statement on her instagram story but we kept talking to each other cause i was fine with that i just like cuddling and chilling with her went out sometimes but lately its been a little different she wouldn t reply to some of my messages and would just leave it there and not text me no more until i text her  now she replies fast when i do but the first thing happens again  asked her on a date this weekend she said she works sun and sat i said we can reschedule she never got back with me  now should i just leave this girl alone cause sometimes if you stick around they may actually want something cause you already built something with each other  and we have been talking for a few months now she would randomly face time me when i stop texting her for a day or two  but honestly its getting annoying when she doesn t respond sometimes  my question  should i move on or should i still see other people in the process and stick around with her cause i really do like her a lot i just don t know how to move on  or should i tell her how i feel cause i have no problem doing that either to see if she still has the same feelings for me like she said she did awhile back you know get a sense of where her head is at   Cause i feel like she just wants to have sex with random dudes and i dont want her doing that cause she came to me initially wanting to just have sex and we did but it carried on to something else after and we both got caught up with each other i just hate thinking that she is thats all
271,0,He buys sex  That s all hes ever done My ex used to pay escorts for sex b  we dated  with me he would have sex with me in order for me to do his laundry   or go to the store for him  While he was with me  he gave this gurl online so many compliments and praised her ass in order for her to send videos and pictures of her naked ass   He sees sex as a way to get things  Not as a way to love and feel connected to someone  It hurts and it is the complete opposite of what I believe sex to be   What do you think causes this kind of behavior 
272,0,I  F middle school  feel unable to express love for my GF  F middle school My school is some what conservative and most kids are a  holes towards others  After a failed first try of asking out my friend  she then asked me out  and I said yes   The problem is that she doesn t really want to express her feelings with me while in school   or  potentially  in her youth group   And hides any affection towards me when someone we know walks by  She kinda expresses that she doesn t want to get bullied by our classmates as well   I don t know if I feel to pushy though  I also don t know that if I break up how she will be affected   last time she was in a break up she told me she cut herself   I feel somewhat trapped  dragging on something that died when it started

274,0,Unmotivated husbandSince I moved in and got married my husband has been steadily gaining weight for years and any aproach I make to get the momentum going for diet and exercise turns him off from the idea of a diet completely   I say I would like him to get healthy with me and he agrees to go allong with it except he doesn t even try  I ask him to go on a walk longer than    minutes and he complains  I ask if he ll go to the gym with me in the evening  he complains  I get in the car regularly finding fast food bags and sodas in the front seat  He brings boxes of cookies home and eats them that same day   He knows he s gained weight  a lot of weight  I really don t think he cares to even try and I can t even bare to see his rolls anymore  It s a massive turn off and his lack of motivation is so mentally unstimulating   I love him  but he s going to wind up an old sick man and I don t want to have to deal with that when it s conpletely avoidable  What s a girl to do 
275,0,Those who ve let back someone who cheated  did it backfire on you or did it workout My F    boyfriend M     now ex  didn t actually physically cheat on me but I found messages of him trying to meet up with a girl  In the messages he was asking the girl for nudes and expressing how he d like to meet up with her  They didn t meet up but it looked like she didn t respond to him  So if she did I know he would have  Needless to say I left as soon as I saw these messages  Brought it up to him and he was quiet the whole time  Now he s crying to me and begging me to come back  Saying it was a mistake and he wouldn t have followed through with it  of course I don t believe that   He s saying how he s going to prove to me that it was a mistake and that he deeply cares for me  says he ll do anything to keep me  I told him to kindly fuck off  Of course this hurts like hell  I wish it didn t happen  I d never do such a thing to someone  I m just curious if anyone s taken back a cheater and it actually worked out  Like  do you think someone can really change  Or that it can genuinely be a stupid mistake and people realize what they had is too great to risk losing

277,0,My    m  girlfriend    f  of     years is the most amazing person  but also not the brightest  I owe her so much in my life  yet I constantly have doubts Hey Reddit  This is going to be a long one  and also by no means I would like you to go into wrong assumptions basing on the title and end on  r iamverysmart  I m just a regular guy   To start off  meeting my girlfriend is possibly the best thing that happened in my life  She fell in love with me while I had not too much going on in my life and was  imo  a solid       she was completely out of my league   She built my self confidence  helped me to get out of some complexes  we went together through the sex life issues I ve had in the past  loves me like I never thought somebody could ever do and we literally never argue because we will always find a compromise  We listen to the similar music  love same cuisine  TV series  like to explore similar cultures   places  party  like to smoke weed once in a while together  she taught me to snowboard and I felt in love in it as well and many  many more  Overall a GREAT person to me and we can t seem to be bored next to each other   I had been quite career focused for the past years and she fully supported me in it  I m also a very competitive person  I ve graduated from the best university in the region and just got promoted to a lower level manager  amp  developer at a huge company from financial sector which overall makes me feel super lucky in that area as well    She  on the other hand  was raised in a quite well off family  works in family ran business and didn t even try to go into university   I wouldn t mind that at all  but you can sometimes feel her sadness that she s not progressing in life to the point I can t cope with it and I m trying to keep my successes to myself not to overwhelm her with them   she is always very proud though  I did run short out of cheering methods  as she really isn t doing much to develop as a person  except going to the gym  where I don t think she s giving      of herself as well   I m coming up with multiple ideas what she could be doing  but she refuses to help herself as she always think she would fail  She considers herself math illiterate and that it destroys her chances of getting any degree or interesting job  I ve tried teaching her myself  but it is really a hard task  as she really is not the brightest  To visualize how problematic it is  I can t get to share one of my hobbies with her  poker   texas hold em  as she can t understand any strategies or even what  and why  odds two facing players would have against each other  This is honestly not rocket science and I m a rather patient person while explaining stuff  She also really TRIED to understand that  as it was her idea to learn  Examples like that could pile up   The career is not the only thing though  She is contributing to our finances more than I would even like to  I guess I wouldn t even mind to provide for both of us if that was her will  but I would like her to develop her passions  hobbies  make herself proud  progress in basically anything   Unfortunately  she gives up super easily in basically anything she s doing and I m encouraging her to do  I know I might sound like an asshole  I don t think I was legitimately proud of her accomplishments once  except the snowboarding thing   she s the boss      It makes me so sad to watch her being unhappy about herself and yet not doing anything about it  I would like her to beat me in a game  surprise with a skill or knowledge  but she s not really making optimal decisions ever  To be able to learn from or be inspired by the love of my life sounds great  yet the feeling is totally unknown to me   Very often I think I wouldn t meet anyone that good ever in my life again  I think I love her  and at this point she s not even subtle in one thing anymore though   she wants that ring  and wouldn t mind a kid as well  so I guess this is one way or another  Do you think it is possible to live in a relationship like that for the rest of my life  Maybe I m the one that is creating the problem  I talked with her multiple times that I would love her to find something she loves doing and progress in it  but I don t want her to feel pressured to do that   I don t want her fulfilling my dreams  I want her to get legitimately interested in something    Thanks for reading  amp  plzhelp 
278,0,Would it be weird if I    F  brought up having previously matched with the same guy    F  on a dating app Explanation of events might be a bit confusing so I ll explain as best as I can  So in my course  there s this cute guy I ve been eyeing for a while  I ve been trying to think of ways to approach him but I chicken out every time  Last night  I downloaded a dating app that I had also downloaded last year and deleted later in that year  After creating a new profile  I came across a cute guy  Then I realised the cute guy is the same guy I matched with last year  and the same cute guy from my course  It s probably been about    months since we talked on the app   We ve talked briefly in class but I don t think he recognises that it s me as we didn t interact much  other than adding each other on social media last year  all of which I again  deleted later in that year   What I want to know is  would it be weird if I bring up that we matched on the app last year  Would it be creepy or just put him in an awkward position  Since he doesn t seem to recognise me  I m thinking maybe a fresh start would be better and pretend we ve never seen each other before  I swiped right with my new profile lol but I m not sure if he ll do the same again  Would it be appropriate to bring it up then   If you were the guy in this situation  would you feel weird about it being brought up 
279,0,Update  I    F  am coming to the realization that I might not have a future with my husband    M  Original Post  https   www reddit com r relationship advice comments b wz n i   f am coming to the realization that i might      So I realize I am probably the last person on earth that anyone wants to hear an update from  Many of you all made it pretty clear that you think I m a terrible human being  and honestly I think it s what I needed to hear     See  there s a lot I didn t share   I was sexually abused as a teenager   People looked at me like a piece of meat that they could just play with  and as a result I m not a very sexual person   I don t feel good about my body  I feel gross and fat  and when I am intimate with my husband  I leave the lights off  hide under the covers  don t want to be seen     I didn t share this  because frankly it s embarrassing and because it s not a justification for how I m feeling  though it does play into it     So I met with my therapist today  She s a lovely woman but she tells me to do what feels good in my heart  So I went in there today and instead of talking about how I felt  I talked about the comments here and how those made me feel  and we had a very productive discussion   Basically  I m projecting those feelings from my past onto my relationship with Chris   It s hard because while he s not old  he is older than me   So I immediately just feel like prey  even though he s never treated me like that     Also  I never had a plan for being out of debt   My therapist asked me what I planned to do  and I didn t have an answer   In the back of my mind  I ve seen myself as someone that Chris was just taking care of in exchange for my body   Note  I literally just said this out loud for the first time today  so please don t think this was a hold back   So once I was out of debt  my flight response took over   She thinks that I saw the baby as something he was asking for in exchange for what he did for me  and that s why I reacted as I did     I will probably catch flack for this  though I can t imagine some of you could possibly hate me more than you already do  but on my way home I called up Brad  the guy from work   He s one of a few people that have been flirting with me   He s funny  sweet  good looking  and constantly tells me I m beautiful   I told him that this Friday  my car is being worked on and asked if he would be able to drive me to and from work   My car is not being worked on  it s his day off  and I wanted to test him   He immediately said that he already had plans to go out with friends  but if I wanted to play hooky I was welcome to tag along   I politely declined   The fact is  the flirting is nice  but at the end of the day  he s not the guy I can count on   Deep down inside I knew that  and I did this to prove it to myself     Tonight  I sat him down and asked him why he wanted a baby   He laughed and said he always wanted kids with me  that we d make beautiful kids together  and that he wanted to be young enough to actively participate in their lives and not put the whole thing on me   I could feel tears welling up in my eyes      Why did you ask me to marry you   I asked him   He laughed at the question   Because I m in love with you  I liked you the minute I met you  but you were so much younger   I didn t want to be creepy and gross you out   Then you moved in  we realized how much we had in common  and I just really loved having you here   When things became romantic  it was like life came together and I didn t want to go another day without making that promise to you       Why do you want to have sex so much  You know it makes me uncomfortable  and I just feel gross    He apologized saying that he knew I wasn t terribly sexual  but that he got so excited with me  He described it as sharing a bed with the most beautiful girl ever  wanting to just hold her close forever  and wanting to be with her in every way   And being frustrated at the fact that she can t see how beautiful she is   I started crying  and he put his arms around me     We kissed  and it was nice   It was passionate  it was deep  I could feel it  I love this man   I let him undress me without hiding  it was hard  I was scared  and he kept repeating over and over how beautiful I was   We made love  and after we were finished  I honestly felt it   As I m approaching     I realized I m scared of getting old   But regardless of whether or not I m with Chris  I m still going to get old   While I may have missed out on dating in my    s I also got to skip a lot of the bullshit  shame I dealt with that between        and probably saved myself a lot of aggravation that would have led me to a much worse place   I know many of you are probably reading this thinking that I don t deserve my husband   You re right  I don t  but for some reason  he chose me   To all of you  especially those who told me what an awful human being I am  thank you   You told me exactly what I needed to hear to stop myself from ruining both of our lives over a quarter life crisis   While I m not      where I need to be  I m working on it  and he s worth making myself uncomfortable to get better 
280,0,Girlfriend has announced she will go away for a year with a friend She told me she already had these plans in place before we met   months ago   She didn t realise how kuch we would grow to like each other until recently  then finding the courage to tell me   We both feel a strong bond and confident of seeing through this period   For those that have experienced a similar situation  what tips do you have for us   She will not go away for another   months  but it is hard not to think about it and fear it 
281,0,I    M  could use a little motivation and help to gain the courage to ask someone out for coffee Sorry for posting here again  I ve just never been this nervous before and my mouth has gotten dry and my foot was tapping like crazy during work even thinking about this     A little backstory  I never had any luck with girls and have done a lot to improve myself over the years and although I got a lot of confidence in a lot of aspects of life  except for romance wise  Not having any experience talking with girls or even being friends with them through HS and even now must ve fucked me up because I can t summon up the courage to even ask someone out on a date    Right now I ve got a very cute girl in my class and I feel like she s very out of my league but I ve talked with her just perfectly and I never felt anything  odd between us  She s really kind so that s even more of a reason not to be nervous about asking her out just for a coffee  I know things will change after this  I actually overheard her and another classmate talking about a guy previously in our class and he had asked out the other girl and she was telling my crush about it  It definitely was tense between the two and it s probably because that dude made it that way but  even writing this out makes me think I m overthinking it        edit    I did it    after staring at the message for over an hour I can t believe I did it  Well  I was too nervous to directly ask to get coffee so I suggested we study at the library  I hope that wasn t weird or a bad decision 
282,0,He    m  broke up with me    f  after    years I don t even know where to begin with this  We met very young obviously  started by chatting online  met months later IRL  ended up dating  I consider us both somewhat  how do I put this without it having a negative connotation    childish immature for our age so I always thought we were progressing at our own pace regardless of everyone else  We would see each other on weekends mostly     yrs ago now he bought an apartment of his own  We initially agreed that we would wait with moving in together until I had an indefinite contract at my current job because I never wanted to depend on anyone financially   Fast forward to   weeks ago  I had to address his distant behaviour towards me recently which ended up in him presenting me with his very firm idea of us no longer working together as a couple because we don t know how to talk to each other  It s not that we don t know how  we choose not to because he can t stand seeing me sad or disappointed and I m super non confrontational so we just bottle things up each on our own end  He said he swept the things that bothered him about me us under the rug too many times for him to be happy anymore   He said he expected we would have gotten further in   yrs together and that he thought I would have moved in with him  without ever actually directly asking me to do that  Upon my inquiry he said I didn t show enough interest for the household shared life in general  I have a physically demanding job  I don t think he even realizes the extent of it  so the weekends that we spent together were my sanctuary  a way to recharge  I would cook  do dishes and vacuum every time   Apparently I also don t ever have the right words to cheer him up when he s having a bad day  how would anyone when you never talk about your feelings or talk about them to others but not the one you re in a relationship with  and he said I don t show enough initiative for things as in   we I never do anything on my own initiative  have a strong feeling sex is included in here too    On the other hand he s prone to rage episodes triggered by the pettiest things sometimes and when that happens I don t know how to deal with it  Imagine having a failure in a game ruin your entire day  He s also a big planner and expects everyone else  mostly me  to be that way too  I like planning vacations and getaways abroad but a short day trip to a nearby town is never something I thought about far ahead of time   So in summary  two people afraid of open discussion about feelings and expectations  basically perfect couple on the outside but storm brewing on the inside  We were good as long as it was fun and games but we never learned to discuss the important things in life   He said he ll always love me but recently its been hard for him to say  I love you  because he feels he s no longer in love with me  He would like to stay friends because he knows there s too much investment that happens over   yrs to just cut each other out completely  We do after all have a strong foundation in the things we have in common and we still share the same values after all this time  We haven t grown apart in any sense that would make us incompatible  We said goodbye in tears  I said I was sorry we screwed this up so badly   he is too  He said he ll always be there for me if I needed anything   For now I ve never after the first   days initiated contact with him myself but he keeps messaging me everyday  From the start he would ask about how I m doing but I simply ignored the question and casually commented on whatever news or stories he linked me that he thought I d find interesting   I don t know what to think or how to deal with this  I want another shot with him because I believe our issues are something that can be worked out but he s not seeing that as an option right now   My question is    do I cut him off completely for a while  What are the odds of him missing me enough to reconsider his decision 
283,0,I  M    confessed my feelings towards my friend  F    and was rejected  We remained friends but I still like her romantically and I think she may be using that fact to take use me As the title says  I confessed my feelings for her early on in the school year  she rejected me saying that I wasn t her type at all  nice way of saying she doesn t find me attractive   which is fine  we agreed that we could still be friends afterwards  I still like her both as a friend and romantically  As an aside  I think she knows for sure that I like her more than she likes me    Recently she has started to ask me for a lot of help studying after class  even going so far as to ask me to help her study on weekends  which is strange because she previously outright refused to study with me or preferred being with her other friends during her free time   By study  I mean basically teach her the entire course because I did really well in the course and she is going to write her final in a few weeks   I don t really think she s doing this to show me that she s interested in me now because her behaviour other than that hasn t significantly changed aside from her being very appreciative and somewhat more open talkative she initiates text conversations now rather than me     My question is  from an outside perspective  what do you think  My main concern is that I don t want to be used but I can t really tell if I am because I m  somewhat blinded by rose coloured glasses because I enjoy spending time with her    Edit  I don t expect to get anything out of helping her study  I study with my friends all the time and we do it just as an excuse to hang out afterwards    I just want to know if I should treat this situation as if any friend asked me to teach them an entire course across   days  something that nobody would realistically ask and I would need a really good reason to even do   or if it is her asking me knowing that I like her and would probably help her just to spend time together a k a using me   Edit    Should I continue to help her  note that I also have finals coming up and so helping her prevents me from doing other things on those days because it takes    hours to go through a section of the material  total of   sections   I ll be completely honest  if one of my male friends asked me to do this  I would have given them my notes  Note  I also offered her my notes as an alternative but she said that she genuinely doesn t understand anything in the course  and told them to ask me any specific questions but I definitely wouldn t spend    hours helping them    I m kinda answering my own question here but the thing is I don t like the idea of people thinking I ll of me  so I help people a lot and I used to get taken advantage of a lot because people knew this  since then I ve gotten a lot better at saying no but I m still kinda weird about being disliked  not by the person but by other people observing the situation   So I m also kinda asking if I would be considered an asshole  from an outside perspective  for telling them that I won t be able to teach them the rest of the course

285,0,I wrote this to my girlfriend about not feeling like a prioritySo I    M  plan on reading this to my girlfriend    F  tomorrow and was wondering if it s too mean or if I should take anything out or just general opinions on it  A little background  we met at my work  she gave me her number and we ve been inseparable since  She babysits two nights a week and I help her  names have been changed  Tom is her make best friend that I ve met and hung out with several times  she is NOT cheating or planning to  This is strictly based on our relationship    We ve kind of had this talk before but after like a month  things this week have reverted back again and I want to say something and at least ask why that is before it gets any further  She goes every two years to Hawaii for a month with her family and after seriously dating for   months  her and her family decided I can come along for a week  School and work make us very busy  but we do spend a lot of time together doing hw and watching her siblings  but due to her siblings being   months and   years old  we go on our phones a lot and don t really talk much then  We agreed to take       minutes when we hang out to talk and just be together to  I mention that in there a few times  Thanks a ton     Before I say anything I want to make sure you understand that this is the team of me and you vs  the problem  not me vs  you  Also  none of this  by any means  is an attack on you at all  I want to fix this  not make you feel like shit  and this is all from MY perspective so it s bound to have some things that in your perspective isn t true  Finally  I want you to know I m saying this because I love you and want us to last for a long time   I know we talked about this before and that we agreed to cross this bridge when we get there but this has been eating at me for the last few days and I have to bring it up and at least let you know how I feel so we can work on it together    Especially with the new job thing and the huge step forward in our relationship with Hawaii  I ve been thinking about us and how we re going to work and make us time happen  I know we talked about my       minutes and even though we mutually agreed on that  I m sorry  but I feel I deserve more than that  I understand were together often and that you have friends that you hang out with a lot and that they are super important in your life  but I should be too  And when we just nap and do homework and be on Instagram  Reddit  and talking to other people our phones when we re together  I don t feel important to you  especially if that s ALL that happens when we re together and even more so if you go out with your friends after    While I love you and your siblings and taking naps with you and doing homework next to you  that s not all I want to do with you  I want to be the one you clear out part of your schedule for  I want to be the one you go out for a few drinks with at the end of the week  i want to be the one to watch a movie with you at night  I want to be the one you make sure you take a nap earlier in the day for so you re well rested and can devote time to    Thursday night when I didn t want to talk about what was bothering me  this was it  that it does make me feel uncomfortable and unimportant that you go out for drinks with Tom or anyone else at the end of the week and sleepover there instead of doing that kind of stuff with me  Like all our  dates  during the week involve homework and naps and your siblings  and when you finally get away from all that and can give someone you re undivided attention for a while  you go out and do  date  things with someone else  Like how am I supposed to feel about that  It hurts knowing that I get       minutes of your undivided attention to myself  but other people get more than that   And what hurts most of all is that this isn t something that you see  or if you do  it isn t something that you ve said or acknowledged isn t the case or feel is important to me  That we ve talked about this before and I still feel this way  That you don t naturally want to do that with me  that at the end of the week  you want to have drinks and do  date like  things with someone else instead of me  How am I supposed to feel like a priority if that happens most of the time    If the next few days  or weeks  or even months in our relationship aren t something you can put much time into  I need to know those kinds of things  If I need to take a step back and give you some space to be with your friends  then let me know so I can do that  I m not going to be happy  but that s a sacrifice I m willing to make for a week or two  If I m doing anything wrong  please let me know so I can fix it and make you want to do those kinds of things with me  And if those are sacrifices you aren t willing to make  let me know so I can take some time away and come to terms with how I feel about continuing our relationship in that manner  I love you and want to be with you whenever I can  but I also want to be a priority in your life  because you re the top one in mine    TLDR   Don t feel like a priority  is what s in quotes ok to say

288,0,How do I     M  leave a relationship  with    F  that hasn t moved past high school level dating in   years of being together I have been in a relationship with someone for almost   years  During this time  we have kissed on the lips twice   We at our best we saw eachother   a month  at our worst we saw eachother once every   months   We live    minutes away  she has a car I dont  I have tried discussing the future with her and met a wall of  I dont knows  I havent tried since  But I still am and want to be good friends with her  and her sister who I have been best friends with   Here s the part that is going to make everyone hate me   During my first year of college I was forced to live on campus  during this time we did not see nor talk ro each other for   months  And during this time my depression spiraled out of control  To the extent I lost over    lbs in   months due to lack of eating   I cheated on her during this time  I know there is no excuse I can use or say  I had no friends on campus and my family was a   hour bus ride away  And I was miserably lonely  It hangs on my neck like a ball and chain filled with guilt  I confided in a friend  who is now holding the fact that he knows this  and he can out me in a group chat at any time  over my head after me after him and I got into an argument   Where the fuck do I go from here  Bring on the hate  I m a cheater one of the worst people in the world and I deserve  But I want to move on with this relationship  with my life  and I want to not live in fear and guilt any longer  
289,0,GF got very drunk and a guy tried to kiss her  she saysAn incident happened when my GF was out clubbung with her sports team  I wasn t around   She says she got so drunk that she had  blackouts   couldn t remember portions of the night   In the morning she had a huge bleeding graze down one forearm   she has no idea how this happened  She had lost her credit card   she says she thinks she remembers getting a taxi to a shop to make a cash withdrawl to pay the driver  She told me one of the guys in her sports team tried to kiss her  she didn t like it and that she pushed him off  She can t remeber anything else that happened    amp  x   B   A month later  we were at a large event  and her sports team was also there  Before ran into the team  she was introducing me to her friends  etc  When we met the team  she went off and gave the guy a friendly hug  But I noticed she didn t introduce me to any of them   which is odd  because I play the same sport as her  and we all would have had lots to talk about  I told her that I was considering talking to the guy and asking him why he tried to kiss her  because it really up set her  I wanted to stand up for her and let him know that his behavior wasn t acceptable  She said not to do that  so I didn t    amp  x   B   I have always found this event disturbing  and there was something in my intuition that tells me there was more to it  Our relationship went though a rough patch  then got a lot better  and she began saying she wants to communicate with me more  and wants a more serious relationship  One night I said that that incident had always worried me because I could feel that there was more she wasn t telling me  I asked her to be open with me about it and tell me everything that happened  This led her to get angry  I calmly reminded her that whenever there has been anything about me that she was worried about  I have always spent as much time as she needed to talk about everything and to reassure her  Her response was to escalate with anger  and an argument followed    amp  x   B   The day after the drunken episode  she messaged one of the other guys in the team and told him to  please don t spread it around if you saw anything   I m curious why she would do that if all that happened was he tried to kiss her  After all  she s told me that on most nights out clubbing  one of her friends ends up snogging someone  never her  of course     amp  x   B   A few days later  she called me  we live in different cities  and said she would like to talk with me about that night  She tells me that the guy started kissing her and she responded and was kissing back  I asked how long it lasted   she couldn t remember  I asked if there was any touching   she couldn t remember  I asked if they went anywhere to do this  or if this was just in front of the group   she couldn t remember going anywhere else  I asked if she slept with him   she says no  but admits she doesn t really know  but  she wouldn t do that   I asked if it s possible they found somewhere in the club or outside and had sex   she says no  she wouldn t do that  but she has told me that she has previously had sex with a guy outside a club in an ally before her and I got together     amp  x   B   So  I really don t know how I should react to this  Her story changed from  a guy tried to kiss me  I didn t like it and pushed him off  to  a guy did kiss me  but I pushed him away  to  a guy kissed me  and I responded   How can I trust her now  She was initially telling me a watered down version so that she didn t look bad  For all I know she s doing the same now   And just imagine if I did talk to the guy at the event and told him  Look  my GF told me you tried to kiss her and she didn t want you to and pushed you off  That s really not cool  don t ever do that again   He might have said  What are you talking about  she was all over me   and I would have looked like a complete fool    amp  x   B   How should I approach this 
290,0,I    f  wavechecked a super cute boy    m  who wasn t ready Omg guys this is a whole repost  but I just had people confused about durags  waves and weaves        Roasting this friend is part of our relationship with HS friend  Our whole thing is him trying to spit game at one of us  us curving him with a roast and him getting us back    times harder  then we go back and forth  We even had a whole groupchat with our friends and his group where all we did is roast each other and reject him  But it s harmless because he s very confident in himself and does not feel bad about getting rejected  because he never gets rejected outside of our group  Think  go home roger  from that rlly old mowry show     There is nothing sexier than a guy with a velvet du and a nice smile of pearly whites  I cannot stress this enough  Except for the waves underneath  There s so much work that goes into waving so that makes it even more attractive because he put in effort into his appearance  This is true for me and my group of friends  We were all talking about this while we were walking downtown after class   We ran into the old friend from high school  we graduated last year   and he was with two friends we haven t met before  They were all wearing velvet durags  So after we caught up with the friend  we complimented them all on them  His third friend is really  really  really cute  with a really nice smile  Like the kind that ll light up a room  He was a lot quieter than the other two  but he wasn t awkward  HS friend is full of himself  but in the best way possible  He s cocky  but he s entertaining and lives up to it  So  he forgot how to act when we complimented him and was asking what we know about  baby blue du s  and making some   My friend called him out and said his hair is probably dry as hell  That he was just wearing the durag as fashion  She compared it to that useless decorative towel that no one s allowed to use  We told him to humble himself because we knew he had no waves  We were obviously talking out of our asses  because we had no clue what was underneath it   He asked if it was a wavecheck and we said it was  He takes off his durag and his waves were IMMACULATE  So because he was right  he got cocky again  His friend told him to calm down and that his waves were better  So we all start saying  wave check    the whole time he s being  fake humble  It s hard to describe  but he was doing the whole  no  I shouldn t  and pausing while he was taking off his durag  He takes his durag off and his waves are nice  We re overhyping him up and having fun  Then it s the third friend s turn  He starts acting shy  but we think it s the fake humility the other guy was showing  So we re still saying  wave check  and his friends are hyping him to do it  He took off his durag and made that  give me your worst face   When I say it was drier than the Sahara   believe me   A wavebrush never touched his scalp  His friends are laughing at him but we re silent  It was so awkward for us  He really was just wearing the durag as a fashion accessory  But luckily  he s laughing at himself too and said this is why he wanted to keep his durag on  That lightened up the mood  and I said that he could  c he would have no waves  But looking back at it  I feel bad because I know that  c hair is a lot harder to manage   He s super cute and I gave him my number  but HS friend said he worried about texting me because he s embarrassed about how things went down  HS friend said he wants to text me  but I feel like he s giving me an excuse and his friend isn t interested  If he was interested  he d text me  HS friend gave me his number to text him first but I don t think he ll want me to  I think he might be uncomfortable if I text him  considering he isn t texting me first  So I should I text him or not  Do I PRETEND THE WAVE CHECK THING NEVER HAPPENED OR MAKE IT MY OPENING MOVE   I feel like we re such bitches for that  we had no clue he wasn t going to wave and we peer pressured him into taking it off  With the energy and vibes going on  I thought everyone was ready for a wavecheck  He probably thinks we re a bunch of bullies  but we just into the moment   We felt so horrible  because earlier we were joking around about HS friend having no waves and wearing it for fashion  BUT THE WHOLE TIME THIS POOR GUY WAS WEARING IT FOR FASHION  He was laughing  but I think we peer pressured him  At the core  he embarrassed himself in front of pretty girls and his friends laughed at him 
291,0,Im    M  our last school year together    F  will be tomorrow and i dont on what to doSo there s this girl   F  that i liked  we were classmates since in  th grade  i always liked her but i just hid the fact that i like her  i dont know how we got to know each other but i just remembered back in  th grade we started to talk and get close to each other  so fast forward a little bit  i just realized that she was boyish  thats not a problem with me but its been a deciding factor  she has her own squad and i have my own squad but both of our squad do get along pretty well  we hangout often and go swimming sometimes  its a blast  D  but after like a few hangouts again  i just realized that my close friend    M  used to hit on the girl i liked  i wasnt mad or anything i just wanted to know what the outcome was  and behold  i learned that my close friend has been hitting on her for a very long time  ever since on  th grade to be precise  i asked him on why they didnt get along with each other and his answer is pretty sad    I dont even know dude  I really tried but she doesnt seem to give me any answer    are you still with me  ok good  I had a few laughs to this even though it hurts me but before the school year ended my close friend started showing me some messages that the girl i liked finally gave an answer  Look im sorry that i always mocked at you for trying to hit on me  i realized that i was dumb and stupid for doing that  it was really brave of you to confess tho  but i just wanna tell you that even though i act boyish  i still have a girly side with me  and that girly side favors you  I mean i dont know what to say but my close friend told me that he doesnt want to hit on her anymore  his efforts were worthless and she only realized that she made a mistake only when its too late  now its time for the main part  in our last hangout like a week ago  i started to feel kinda awkward around her ya know  like she would talk to me in a manner that i never heard her before  but the thing that really like REALLY made me think was the time when i was alone on the swings  i was pretty tired of swimming at that time so i decided just to rest there for a while  i dont know what got into her but she approached me  ME from all of the other friends she has she approached ME  and she goes  want me to push you   and at that point and time i dont know what got into me and i just straight up stood up and went like   nope  thats kinda weird  as i stood up she just sat on the swing and i sat beside her  then she proceeds to talk to me about her day and stuff  and     i kinda liked talking to her  we talked about some personal stuff  we are already friends but were not on the page where we can talk about personal shit   I felt really good after that talk  But boy oh boy here it comes  next year we will be in   th grade  probably our last year meeting with each other  and i need your help on what should i do  i want to tell her that i liked her for a very long time  but i dont want to weird her out and lose her  i can be friend zoned thats fine with me but i just need help on should i tell her or not  this thing is bugging me this whole summer  i kinda get sad all the time just thinking of not meeting her   TL DR i liked a girl ever since on  th grade and i need help on should i tell her that i like her or not   P S this is the first time i wrote a post so forgive me for any mistakes  also its my first time to confess to someone so im downright serious about this CHEERS

293,0,Me   M  and my  girlfriend     F  broke up   weeks ago after a   year long relationship and my family dislikes her now but we ve been talking and bonding again  and honestly shes like my best friend and I want to try again and so does she  What should I tell my family We were in the relationship for   year and it ended kinda bad but with nothing other then feelings getting hurt but still bad  and my mum said to me I should never get back with her and I agreed but my  girlfriend  and I have been talking and she seems to have gotten her head straight  I wanted to give it another shot but my mom said that and my sister just plain out doesn t like her  At all  I think my mom could change cause she is just saying whats best at the time but idk about my sister 
294,0,Am I his first girlfriend Hi there  It s difficult to know if a guy has never had a great or sex but I have my suspicions  Here goes the story   We ve known each other for a little more than a decade and for that time we ve been best friends  There were some indications that he was into me but because he used to talk so much about other girls I kind of assumed that he wasn t into me  A couple of years after we became friends he told me he started a relationship with a girl  For the next   months  at least  he was telling me all kinds of stories about their relationship  including sex and because he asked me certain things about sex advice I assumed it was the first time had sex  I never thought about it then but I d never actually met his girlfriend even though we were best friends and hung out every day  IDK why I never thought it was strange but now I do think it s strange  We were even studying at the same building she was studying and she never ever came to see him nor he ever went to see her while at the same building    I think it s strange but back then I thought it was perfectly normal     After that relationship has ended he didn t have a great for a few years but he always used to tell me about all the girls he d met and made out with  They were not his gfs nor did he sleep with them  he just made out with them  I do think it s BS and many guys do it  Even at that time I thought it was bs   Then  after a few years  he told me he found a new GF  Back then we didn t have as much contact as we did before so he didn t spend hours telling  me all the details about their relationship  A friend did see him on the street holding hands with a girl so I natural assumed that it was his gf   After that one  he had another gf  Unlike the previous gf  he posted pics with this one but the pics were always kind of ambiguous  like I was never sure if they were together or not  Like  they were hugging but lightly so it could have been a good friend  too  We haven t spoke much during that period  that s why I didn t know if it was his gf  Later  when we reconnected  he told me they were together   Fast forward to our relationship  I started flirting with him and he immediately responded but then backed off until we finally kissed some two months later  BTW  I kissed him first because he was so sweaty and nervous and was wiggling in his seat not knowing if he should kiss me or not  We immediately started kissing and taking our clothes off and kind of having sex  He had performance anxiety  We were cuddling afterwards and it was very emotional and romantic so I definitely know that he likes me a lot if not loves me   We ve only had sex a couple of times after that and every time we are about to have it  his heart starts pounding like crazy  so I ve never pushed him into having sex  During it he kind of looks like he knows what he s doing but then in practice he doesn t  I mean  I know that he watches porn and he definitely picked up a lot of things from it  On the other hand  things that are generally not present in porn  like varying rithm etc  he doesn t do  It s like he saw that in porn sex is generally fast and furious and that s what he thinks sex is   Another thing   I figured that he didn t know how to kiss  it s like  he would stick his tongue out and that would be it  Over time he got significantly better at kissing though he s adjusting to me and the way I kiss   So you think these things indicate that I m his first gf    I m asking this because if he had a normal and regular sexual life with his previous GFS then I don t know why he s avoiding it with me  If  on the other hand  he s never had a gf and we re both in our   s  to me it would explain a lot of his strange behavior 
295,0,I    M  feel like my mother s friend    F  has feelings for meBackstory  I have known this person for about   years before now however in the time that I have known her I believe that I have changed a lot  A few years ago I was majorly overweight and had no sense of style  since then I lost around   lbs  still need to lose some more as I probably gained back about       but with a lot more muscle  and have since drastically improved my style and the way I carry myself  clothes and the way I act    So fast forward to this year  she recently had a baby with my next door neighbor actually  this guy is a bit of a scumbag and they have quite a few arguments when he drinks or does drugs which means she comes around to my house a lot to vent to me and my mom about what has happened    It wasn t until around   weeks ago that I started to think that there might be something there  we all had a few friends around to have some drinks  by around   am me and all of my friends had had a fair few drinks and she had had only around     glasses of wine and me and her were chatting  probably about     different conversations going at once  and it was a pretty normal conversation with some very few hints of flirting but that changed when my mom  much more drunk  lifted up her shirt  showed bra  she just went with it whilst and kept it up  only me and one other friend were in the room and he was on his phone and didn t really realise   Fast forward to a few days later she still comes around every few days to chat but is always overly friendly and defiantly laughs more and louder than everyone else at my jokes  The final kicker that made me think something was up was when my mom said something about owning a pub and renting out the rooms in the apartment above to me and her and she seemed really on board  no issues at all    What do I do in this situation as she is nice and has a pretty good body but she has a baby  is still on and off with her ex  more off than on  also has a baby and is best friends with my mom   How tf do I go about this without it being extremely weird

298,0,I think my fianc   m    resents me  f    for having friends hobbies outside of our long distance relationship  Need advice Hey all   I am in grad school and live about two hours away from my fianc   We have been together almost   years and got engaged last October  We ve been somewhat long distance for the majority of our relationship and have lived     hours from each other  We plan on living together when I finish school  He can t relocate because of work   We do a lot together as a unit  We have shared interests  friend groups  hobbies  etc  We also commute and spend nearly every weekend together    Understandably  being in grad school full time is stressful  and I also work an assistantship at the university on top of classes and practicum    During the week  I try to do things for me  I have a really great close friend in my cohort  and her and I study and have BFF time together  i e   sit on the couch and watch Game of Thrones and not talk  shoot the shit and play instruments   Having her around is really enjoyable and low impact    I love my fianc   I miss him incredibly during the week and we talk every day  But  he becomes incredibly passive aggressive when I suggest having a weekend to myself  I find myself reaching and having to rationalize why I should get to have  me time  or do something that doesn t include him  He gets upset if I ask for alone time  but then spend time with my friend alone     It came to a head last night when he called me while I was recording a podcast I had been recently recruited to host with a couple of friends  He suggested I drop everything in the middle of a live recording to talk and pay attention to him  He said today that he  built  me  a PC that I ve barely gamed with because  I m  so busy  but  I m  willing to commit several hours a week to record a podcast     I feel as though I ve tried everything  I ve asked to return to therapy and talk it out with a rational mediator  he s attended therapy before to learn some relationship coping skills   I ve been taking more stock into his love languages and have been reading more about it trying to show affection in his  language   and I ve been encouraging him to take up more meaningful hobbies and interests  We re about to adopt a corgi puppy that would live with him  and I think the companionship would be incredible for him    My fianc  works a full time job  and will occasionally go out with our mutual group of friends without me  but I feel as though he doesn t do much else without me  He comes home  watches TV or plays some video games for a few hours  and goes to bed  I feel kind of like he needs a hobby besides our relationship    I m at the point where I feel exhausted and at the end of my rope  I feel as though my fianc  is trying to control me and resents me having independence from him  I want him to be happy that I m doing things to enrich myself and my life  but that s clearly not the case    What do I do  How do I approach this issue with my fianc  who isn t happy unless we re seemingly doing everything together always  I m growing concerned regarding what s going to happen when we move in together  I want to live my life as a whole human being  not just one half to a whole person    TL DR my longish distance fianc  is passive aggressive and jealous    when I do things without him and it s driving me nuts  
299,0,Boyfriend never takes me on dates or give giftsI m a    years old  F  and my boyfriend is just   months younger than me  We ve been in love for   years and this is something that has bothered me since the beginning of our relationship  He is a model student   and he has always been more into studying than in to human relationships    He has only gifted me like   times maybe throughout   years and only after I insisted on wanting something from him  I always gift him with loads of stuff because I love giving gifts because it brings me so much happiness and a sense of being appreciated when I get them    About going on dates   well I always have to plan everything and even then he would sometimes cancel at the last moment  for valid reasons such as  studying    For my   st birthday I gave obvious hints that I wanted roses but all I got is a gold necklace  not like real gold  when he knows I HATE gold and love silver   I really don t know what to do  I know he isn t cheating and that he does love me a lot but he doesn t seem to understand the point of giving presents or the happiness it gives someone to be on the receiving end   Am I being paranoid and an over expecting girlfriend   Edit  I m his first girlfriend

301,0,An idiot ex  Me A bit of backstory  my ex and I have been off and on for almost   years  Every time it was my fault  I would break up with her  and once I cheated  Somehow I would convince her to get back with me   This most recent time  I managed to get her back and move across country with me  It started well  but when my financial situation took a dive so did my mental state  I found myself drunk one night looking for my exes nudes and succeeded  She found out  and we broke up    Since if had the highest level of motivation ever in my life to win her back  Even though I know I ve been a royal POS and deserve her to never talk to me again  I cant help myself from going through every possible Avenue to prove my love to her  because now that I have every woman I could try to be with at my fingertips  I want nothing but her   My question  Do I keep the self improvement to get her back and try to win her back  or just continue the self improvement and leave her the hell alone  Thanks

303,0,I  M    just recently discovered that   of my cousins are actually my half siblingsHello Reddit    amp  x   B   I recently just discovered that   of my cousins are actually my genetic half siblings  F    M    F    M     Turns out that my uncle  my father s brother  could not have children due to a childhood illness and when he married  they asked my father if he would be the sperm donor before my father married my mother  This resulted in the oldest  and a set of fraternal twins  Later after my father married my mother  they approached him again about being a donor because they wanted one more child  My mother said it was okay  and thus the fourth cousin was born    amp  x   B   This cousin who is closer to my age  I have always been very close to  We ve always been like siblings regardless  Always hanging out  always being each other s confidants  etc    Figuring out we were truly siblings was not super shocking because we kind of always felt like we were in the first place  To be clear  with the youngest one I never would ve really suspected that we TRULY were siblings  But since we were so close already it just felt natural   But with the older three I was blown away  We ve always been friendly and cordial  but never really close    amp  x   B   Now that I ve learned the truth about my three older cousins though  I feel guilty    I want to get to know them better and try to have a little bit of a closer relationship with them but I feel selfish about it  I DO NOT seek to like  assimilate them into my family or take them away from their true father  my uncle   But I feel like it would be a shame to let this opportunity pass  I was raised as an only child and feel like a whole new world has opened up to me that I didn t have before    amp  x   B   From what I understand  they don t know the truth  Is there a way I could reach out to the three older ones that wouldn t come off as weird or suspicious  Like I say  we ve always been kind  friendly  and cordial with one another  But never close    amp  x   B   Advice

305,0,My     f  husband     f  says he will never go to the doctor and I m not sure if I should push the matterWe ve been together    years  and all this time I figured he just never went to the doctor because we could never actually afford health care  I ve been lots of times  but I have more health issues and crises  and he s a pretty sturdy fella  rarely gets sick  has never had anything worse than a bad tooth that needed pulled   So since we re getting up there now and are in a better place  financially  I ve been trying to save up for some health insurance  we re both self employed   I mentioned him being able to finally get an examination and ask about some issues he s been having  and he basically laid it out there that  barring a catastrophic emergency that makes it completely unavoidable  he ll never go to a doctor   Obviously  it s his body and his life  so that s his choice and not mine  He s elaborated a bit that he hates medical stuff and has a phobia  He has health issues right now that could be minor  or could be a symptom of something more serious  It seems wild to me that he s against any care  even preventative  if financial stakes aren t even prohibitive  Like me  he has a long familial history of cancer  Currently  he s been walking around with this huge cyst like lump on his thigh  It s the size of a ping pong ball  and it s been there for five years  It doesn t grow or hurt and is probably just a minor thing  but it s still like     Don t you want to get that thing checked out   I literally can see it through fabric  We might need to give it a name at some point    I guess as the person who is spending my life with him and probably will one day in a position to care for him  it just concerns me a lot  and I m not sure if this is a situation where I should keep pushing  or one I should just learn to accept 
306,0,Did I finally find closure with my ex girlfriend Hey guys so I      broke up with my ex girlfriend      over a month ago  The relationship lasted two years  It became toxic and controlling before calling it quits  I said a lot of things I can t take back  At first I was trying to beg her to give me time to change so we could try again  She bashed me on social media and tried to make me jealous for weeks talking to other guys and going out drinking every night  Clubbing every chance she got  But would tell me all of these things to get a reaction  I know I made horrible mistakes in the relationship but it was just odd how someone who said they truly loved me could try to hurt me this much after the break up  Like why not just block me completely and move on  So for weeks I calmed down and gave her space  I know this was a terrible idea but we decided to meet face to face  We both broke down crying  She said she really missed me and wishes she could love me again  I lost a lot of weight since and she picked up a lot of weight  She kept asking if I was seeing anyone  And that she didn t want me to move on  By this point I know everything is about reactions for her  But she made it clear she wants to give someone else a chance when the time is right  And that if it doesn t work maybe we can try again  I told her no it doesn t work that way  Honestly we are trying to friends but it just sounds like a horrible idea  Yes the relationship was toxic but that was my best friend and it ended mostly because of ME  She was honest and didn t know how to leave earlier  And just waited for me to make the choice to end it  Definitely felt like that last time I would ever see her  I m not sure how I feel about everything  But I do know it s time to fully move on and heal  
307,0,I     F  don t know how to ask my new partner     M  if he has herpes  Advice needed Alright so  most people would think this may be a pretty simple thing to ask your partner  especially since it affects your health   but there is a twist to this    Basically  while over at my partner s house  I found a bottle of medication for what is commonly used for genital herpes  The dosage used matches with genital herpes and indicated to  use during flare ups only     I wasn t snooping  he just left it out on the bathroom counter  which was obviously not intentional on his part    I don t really know what to do  because I ve tried to ask him in different ways about it without outright saying I found the bottle of medication  and he just keeps saying he has never had any STDs  I ve been tested recently as well  and had nothing  so I m questioning whether or not he has herpes and the medication is used for something else  I don t want him to think I violated his privacy and was snooping through his medications  because that s not what happened  I m really worried though  obviously    I think I probably have to break up with him because either way I don t see this conversation ending with him being understanding  Any advice on how to bring this topic up or approach the situation is welcome   
308,0,How do you rebuild trust My boyfriend and I have had some trust issues  We ve talked it out extensively and the only next step is to move on  or break up but that s not what either of us wants  in the past couple of months since talking about it things seemed to be much better and more open but I still have my doubts  I feel like I m just waiting for his next mistake  
309,0,The love of my life got married arranged  recently and now I have no drive or motivation left in life to do anything I will start from the beginning   There are two persons in the story excluding me  I will refer them as                  During high school I had a girl    in my class who was introvert  hardly talked to anyone else and was totally focused on her studies  She    didn t really care about having a boyfriend or as a matter of fact much friends  I on the other hand was more social and talkative  She had only one friend    with who she    used to hang out with all the time  During our final year  I became the school head boy and her friend    became the school head girl  We used to hang out a lot due to the various activities we were organising  She    was one of my good friend and I used to share everything with her be it my family issues or anything else going on with my life          Jumping a couple of months ahead  I had a few classes together with her     One fine day  we had a chance of talk as she was my lab partner in one of the class  Soon  we started getting close  I was the only guy she used to text  Her family was very conservative and they didn t really wanted her to get into anything casual or serious   I think what I did next was the biggest mistake of my life   I told my friend     common friend  about her as I developed feelings and she used to listen and advise me what to do in case of problems   After a few months  we talked all the time  day and night  We couldn t stop talking to each other   There was something about her  the innocence  the compassion  I can t describe it          Jumping a few months ahead  Suddenly  something happend and she stopped taking   I got to know that someone told her father about me  he scolded her really badly and took away everything  Now she was not even allowed to leave her house   She kept on ignoring me whenever we see each other  In class  all my calls  messages or what not   Soon  it was time for graduation and we went seperate ways   But I never stopped thinking about her  Not for one moment  I was in love  I wanted to spend the rest of my life with that person  But never really understood what exactly happend and how          Jumping a couple of years  I moved to a different state for my Bachelors   I was not in contact with her but my friend    used to tell me all that was going on with her    life   One day while we were talking  she    suggested that we play a game and share something that we have never told each other   What she told me next tore me apart   When we were in school  she    was the person who took the screenshots of the messages and sent it to the father of girl    I was in love with  That s what happend  That s how he got to know and that was the reason it all happend   I was angry  couldn t believe that she    was the person who did all that  The person I trusted the most did that to me   I told her that I never wanted to hear from her ever again          I tried to contact her    once again and this time out of the blue she replied  I explained everything to her  it was not me who did that or the person to be blamed  I tried my best but she never forgave me   I knew her    aunt from school  I told her that I was in love with her niece  What she said next is what drives me or used to till now   She said   If you want to be taken seriously  you should become someone who has achieved something in life   Translation is a bit off but she meant that I should get a job and then talk to her          I finished my bachelors and moved to EU for my masters which I am about to complete   I had this drive  this motivation that in a couple of years I will get the chance to ask her    parents   We were in contact till last year but then she    stopped responding  I had no way of getting to know what has happend but I was positive that everything will be fine          I got to know last week that she got married to some guy her parents chose for her  arranged marriage   I was broken  I couldn t stop crying and blaming myself for everything  We had plans of living together  I wanted to show the world to her  spend the rest of my life with   But NOW I AM LOST    I feel like my life has no meaning now          She    was the only girl I ever got serious for  I had no relationships in my life  Couldn t say that this counts as one because everything fell apart before it could start  I have never looked at any other girl in the same way  If only I had not made the mistake I made when I was young and foolish  who knows what could have happend          Guys  I don t know what to do with my life  I have nothing to look forward to now  I have lost all meaning          A friend suggested me to share this here  looking for advise  Thank you all for hearing me out  Hope you all get what you want in life          Sorry for the grammatical errors  Not a native speaker   
310,0,My  M    gf  F    always turns any problem I have with relationship into her problemLet s take the past two days for example  I was struggling with our relationship because she had asked another person to prom about a month ago and I was still hurting because she lied to me so she could take her Bestfriend to prom and leave me alone  She told me outside dates weren t allowed  but when I checked her school website  it said the complete opposite  with prices even  and then she started telling me she asked him because he said he wouldn t go  without a date  so she asked him  Because she  didn t want him to miss out on an important day in his life over something dumb     The reason this stung was because     she coulda just asked me and I prolly woulda let her take him      she lied to me      that would have been the first ever dance I wasn t alone      She told me she was going with friends to the after party already  including that friend   So naturally  I m hurting  and then she starts talking down to me  saying  i don t listen  and shit  So I decided to break up with her  and then she fixed things    Fast forward now after a month  everything was going fine  but something in me was still hurting badly  So I decide to tell her I m in pain  I tell her straight up what s hurting me and list it out the way I did earlier in this post  Tell me why she hits me with that  this whole month has been a lie   you don t love me  and etc  Right now  I keep trying to show her I love her  and she won t even let me tell her I love her  she says I  have to show her I love her  and I m honestly just feel like I m dying    I think of it as me telling her I m drowning  and then she pushed me down in order to hop up and tell the world she s drowning    It sucks  I ve honestly just considered not telling her anything and just leaving it as that  I feel like shit because I dunno if I m just a piece of shit  or if I m making the right moves  and it s fucking with my depression    How can I explain to her that I do love her  but I was just hurt by her actions    TL DR  my gf turns my issues into her issues and then I have to bend over backwards to please her  How do I break this stupid cycle    P S   she hit me with that  i don t want any half love  I want full love  and it just feels like she s being passive aggressive towards me and I just feel like garbage  Like fuck man  if depression wasn t bad enough 
311,0,Just found out a guy I matched with on a dating app is in a relationshipNot sure if this is the appropriate sub to post on  so sorry in advance if it isn t   As the title suggests  turns out a guy I matched with on a dating app recently has actually been in a relationship with a girl for over a year  He unmatched with me a day after his last message when he made some offhand remark and I didn t reply  The guy and I went to the same college  so we have a lot of mutual friends who run in the same circles  I came upon an Instagram post he made in the Discovery section which he dedicated to his girlfriend of over a year  who has also moved to NY to be with him  idk where she was originally  but somewhere on the west coast   I d been on his profile before  but he only had like six pictures and none indicated he is in a relationship  until now    I was thinking about shooting her a DM on a throwaway account explaining the situation  but am hesitant  It seems this girl has uprooted her life for him  but if I were in her shoes  I d definitely want to know  I ve never done anything like this or encountered any situation like this before  so I wanted to ask what the proper protocol should be  I also have no evidence  which she may want understandably  since he has unmatched with me  thereby erasing our chat   There also could ve been extenuating circumstances which caused him to go on the app   Any advice would be appreciated   thanks  
312,0,I  f     hate my friend s     m  GF     F  and don t want to invite her to my wedding I keep going back and forth on what to do and would like advice  Sorry if this is long   TLDR  My friend s GF is really annoying and rude and I don t want to invite her to my small and intimate    day wedding   My fiance and I are planning our destination wedding where we will rent out a place for our guests to spend   days together  It will be exclusive use  not a hotel  and intimate in the countryside  so we can only invite less than    people  We have big families which comprises more than half of that number   We did a big move   years ago and have been trying to really determine who is closest to us since now we have friends from where we grew up  college  where we moved from and our new country   Anyway  this was my first friend in my new country and he s great  A few months after we became quick close friends  he started dating someone from a different country  I was really excited for him and assumed if he liked her she would be as awesome as him  When she finally moved over I did my best to hang out with them and get her acquainted with the new place  She was friendly enough but would make weird comments about how accepting she was of our friendship and how people always asked how could she handle us being friends and she didn t care that I was pretty  her words  not mine   It was kind of weird but I tried to shrug it off  She and I were both unemployed for a bit and I would try to reach out to her and hang out  She was generally fine one on one  but still kind of annoying as she dominates the conversation  only talks about her life and everyone she knows  we are from different countries  I do not know Sebastian who you summered with or Joss from elementary   At first it was fine  but it became laborious just to talk to her  This isn t that important  so I will stop ranting   I tried to hang out with her when we were out  but it was never a good time for us  She is the type of drunk who is really loud and gets upset when the attention isn t on her  She sings loudly and is generally belligerent and a nuisance to those around her  She can also be a bit rude and condescending  She has made thinly veiled racist comments to me that others have highlighted but I just shrugged off because I just expect that sort of thing from her    Fast forward a few months and we all go away on vacation with a large group of his childhood friends  siblings and us  and she brings one of her childhood friends  We all get along  except for the GF  who acts like a child  Even her friend is annoyed with her because she would get upset about something and hide away while we all hung by the pool  we rented a huge house for all of us   She made his sister cry  though I do not know the story because my fiance and I were not there for this  Just heard about it the next day because she was sulking in the corner and deliberately took long to get out to a taxi when we were all going to lunch  Just very childish  She also sat outside  away from our table and didn t talk to anyone just chain smoking away  I tried to get her involved and speak to her  but she just said she didn t want to deal with anyone  Okay  I didn t know anything so I let it be  This was literally day   of     Over the next few days she is incredibly mean to my friend and tells him to shut up in front of the whole group  yelling at him in restaurants  etc  Calls him a loser and acts like a diva  Now she had been trying to get a job since arrival and had been having a hard time  so my friend was paying for everything  rent  food  entertainment  vacations  alcohol  you name it  And she just treated him like crap all the time  even before this trip but more so during and after   The last night my fianc  walked into a room where she and her friend were and heard them talking about me and basically saying  don t worry  we wont have to see her after tomorrow   the other women had by this point left and we were there one more night as our flight was in the morning   They immediately looked at him shocked and pretended like nothing happened  It was just weird because I hadn t said anything to her and basically just tried to keep my distance  I have no idea what it could have been that I had done to upset her but knowing her it was probably nothing   Regardless  I have tried to keep my distance since this happened about a year ago  When I do see her I try to be cordial  but I cannot get over how mean she is to my friend  who treats her like gold  I do feel bad because there have been times where she has been nice and bent over backwards to help with something  In those times I feel like I should try harder  but the point remains that she is rude to my friend  annoying and nuisance to others  This is not the sort of person I want to spend three days with our friends and family since we will be doing everything together  And I rather give the limited space to a friend who I would enjoy being there   I am sorry this is long  but I don t know what to do  On the one hand  I want my friend there but cannot only invite him  If I do not invite him  it will be mean and a slap in the face  I thought about talking to him  but other friends in the group say I shouldn t and to just leave him out and pretend like it s nothing  They will be moving back to our home country before the wedding  a year away   so that could be an excuse  But I feel like it is wrong to just not say anything about the snub 
313,0,I    F  fell in love with my ex    M   s cousin    M Reading the title just about gives it away  but I    F  will provide some detail  I have children with a person who I was in a relationship with for several years   M   We started dating as teens and as we grew up together  we grew apart  He has done everything negative one can do and then some  He s not a good person  and I regret not realizing that sooner   There was a period in time where he went to jail for an unthinkable act  and in that time I was staying with his family  I ve always been attracted to one of his cousins  Dave   M   but for obvious reasons never pursued it    As time went on  I began to see Dave for the person he is  and honestly  he is much more compatible with me than any other man I ve met  But  again I played it cool    More time goes on and we are connecting more  having deep conversation and flirting a bit  I figured he was just being friendly  We were sent on an errand together and I noticed his behavior started to change  He was really shy  had a nervous energy about him  Eventually he opened up to me that he kinda has a crush on me  as wrong as it may be  I said nothing  Just figured to leave it at that  But that didn t last long   After the errand he seemed a little distant and wouldn t really talk to me  I asked him what was wrong and he said he kinda put himself out there and didn t get a response  I was lost for words and apologized  I reached out to hug him and he embraced me so close to him  We held each other for a minute and I pulled away   Our eyes met and we kissed  Smh   Fast forward a bit we we exchanged numbers and starting to talk more  We started dating and fell in love  Yes I know it was morally wrong but honestly  compared to what my child s father has done to me this was nothing   This relationship is like no other  We were positively head over heels  obsessively in love with one another  We adored each other  He was and is my soul mate I believe that  He is the most honest  loyal  loving  sensual  intelligent man I know  We actually were planning to get married  the relationship lasted about   years  But eventually we parted ways because it seemed  wrong     How can we explain this to the family etc  and the separation wasn t easy   We mutually fell into a deep depression after the breakup I really don t want to get into details but we were not handling it well at all  Hard to maintain a friendship because we were so obsessively in love it was hard  hurtful  We would agree to give one another time to sort thru our feelings and just kept running back to each other  But again  how can we tell the family      We took a longer break and again fell into a devastating depression mutually  We would text occasionally but it was hard it was very obvious we were both hurting  We just want to get it right  but don t know how to go about this    Do we continue a relationship that doesn t necessarily need to be public just yet  or seek the family s approval so we can be public  If I didn t have children  I wouldn t feel so conflicted  I don t know how to explain to them that someone they ve known as family is someone I seriously want to spend my life with  They love their father  and I expect them to  however I do know this news would cause pandemonium in the family  They aren t close  and I ve always sensed my child s father was jealous of him and other cousins  My child s father is a narcissist  and would likely react physically to myself and or Dave  but I m at the point where I need to live my life  and love who I want to freely   and safely  without worrying about him interfering  I just don t know what to do   TLDR  Had a mutual crush and eventually starting dating child s fathers cousin  Fell in love and have the perfect relationship  Conflicted as to how  if  or when would be the right time to tell the family  
314,0,Am I    F  getting coldfeet of longterm with bf    M  Hi  this might sound strange for those who had several long term relationships  This is my first serious one and we have been together for one year  might sound a little short  but we also lived together pretty much from the beginning   We have been planning for the long haul    like buying an apartment  getting married  having kids    We talk about all these things  However  we had a rough couple of months with work  his sucks and I have recently switched jobs  It s been stressful  but more for him  which led to a lot of arguments  as sometimes he can t get out of thinking about his work and does a lot of overtime while complaining at home  I always try to help  but sometimes it s not enough or I also get tired  Still  we always said that we were lucky that we never go to bed angry and we always  always talk it out  We are fairly loving  cuddly  touchy feely with each other  However  I ve noticed in myself for the last couple of weeks that I m not as passionate as I was before  I don t miss him as much when he is not around  And that I need more alone time    Yet    he is one of my best friends  I know I would be always able to count on him  He would be a super day  A husband who is faithful and reliable  Yet    I m worried about my feelings  When I see him it s not like my  heart swells  and sometimes I m more critical  than I used to  This might be completely normal as I know things eventually settle  As I said  I m very inexperienced with long term relationships of this kind  Also    sometime not very good with my own emotions  Should I worry  Is it the stress or the cold feet  Or something that s just inevitable 
315,0,I    F  am planning a trip to Hawaii in   months for me and my    M  boyfriend but he doesn t knowI m sorry guys  this ones kind of long  Just skip to the bottom if you want the shortened version  Okay so my boyfriend and I have been talking about going to Hawaii for months now and he just keeps pushing it back and it got to the point where we just both gave up because it was too stressful   Well  I am currently in the process of buying tickets and an Airbnb for a week in two months for the two of us  I m not telling him because I want it to be a surprise but he s kind of being a dick about it   I asked him to take a certain week off at work and told him I had something special planned and he was a little skeptical about it but needed up agreeing  Or so I thought  He ended up not requesting the week off and by the time I found out  all the slots for that week were taken  So I got really upset and asked him to take the week before off   Thankfully I hadn t bought the plane tickets yet because it was      for both of us   Well  I spent the night at his house and his sister came over the next morning before I officially got out of bed  He got up to go talk to her and see his nephew and then started talking shit about my whole surprise  thinking I was sleeping still  He said that he s not taking me seriously enough to take his one week of vacation this year to do something that he s most likely not going to like  And then his sister went on to say how he s right because there s no way I would be able to do anything fancy or extravagant  Little do they know I have money saved up  I just don t flaunt it   But anyways  it s just really hurting my feelings that he s going behind my back talking shit to his sister when he thinks I m asleep  I just want it to be special  I ve never done anything like this for us so I want it to be a surprise  And I know he will love it because we have been wanting to go to Hawaii  So should I just tell him  Or do I wait it out like I want to do  I m just afraid he s not going to take me seriously and not request the other week off   The only think I know for certain is that I m going to Hawaii in seven weeks   Long story short  I m planning a trip to Hawaii for me and my boyfriend but I m keeping it a surprise  But I heard him talking shit about not wanting to waste his only week of vacation this year at work on something stupid   He said he was going to request a week off but then didn t  someone else then took the last slot for that week  I then asked him to take a different week off and that s when I heard him talking shit the next day   Little does he know what I have planned is a week of Hawaii  Don t know if I should tell him or wait it out like I want to  My feelings are hurt on how much he s not taking me seriously

320,0,Been abused by my ex  How do I get my standards back My ex was extremely abusive to me  At first  I expected what you would normally expect from a relationship trust  openness  and honesty  But it was my first relationship  and I had low self esteem  so I tolerated his shitty behavior ignoring my messages for more than    hrs on a daily basis  never making plans being romantic to me  and just overall neglecting me and my needs while constantly demanding me to meet his  When I brought up how I felt  he guilt tripped me by saying I was guilt tripping him through bringing up how he wasn t doing enough  And I believed him  I thought I was too difficult and too expectant    In retrospect  he was extremely manipulative and abusive  But I fear that I have been so used to being abused that I don t know what a normal healthy relationship is like anymore  How do I get my standards back

326,0,Do you let you SO have acces to you phone anytime he wants   Why  So  i read stories here on reddit everyday when i m at work on all those common subs   AITA   sex  this one  etc     and i can see many people end up finding out about cheating mainly when they look at their SO s phones  I am in a relationship for about     years now with this girl i love and when we started dating i didn t let her have acces to my phone unless she had a good reason  and i only made that because i really had somethings to hide   i texted other girls and ended up cheating on her    Tired of that unhonest behaviour  she told me if i wouldn t be completely honest with her   like she was being and still is  like when she told me she wasn t feeling attracted by me anymore and was having a crush on other guy  we shouldn t be dating anymore   We now have full acces to each other s phones  and that s something we agreed  because we want to be as honest as possible with each other and i think that s the reason we are still together now  If i ever break up with her i don t see me entering a relationship with someone who won t let me have acces to her phone because if you have nothing to hide  you have nothing to fear 
327,0,I ve    F  been holding back feelings for a friend    M  for   years  I can t tell anyone I know in real life and I don t know how to go on with this anymore I ve been friends with Dan for    years  We met in college and are part of a tight knit group that continues to be close and see each other often   He doesn t know that I ve had feelings for him for a long time  It started as a small crush   nothing serious  I just enjoyed being around him and I cared about him a bit more than our other friends  But since he just saw me as the sibling he doesn t have and I didn t want to jeopardize our group if things became awkward between the two of us for one reason or another  I just kept everything to myself  I was pretty confident that I d meet a lot of other guys and outgrow my feelings for him anyway   And I did  Eight years went by with both of us dating other people while continuing to be friends  I was still very fond of Dan  but I honestly didn t pine for him or feel that I was settling for the boyfriends I had just because I couldn t have him  I was comfortable with our friendship as it was   However  a month ago he broke things off with his girlfriend  and he s been spending a lot of time with me ever since  This is not because he s suddenly interested in me   he s said that he wants to take a break from romatic relationships  and I genuinely think that he just wants to spend time with friends while waiting out a three month break before he starts a new job  And because I am the only friend who lives just a few minutes from him and has free time  he usually ends up with me   The problem is  all this time that Dan and I have been spending with each other and without our other friends has made us much closer  It s not just a small crush that I can ignore anymore   I think I might be falling in love with him   He messages me every day  sometimes short chats telling me about stuff he did  sometimes long conversations about our lives or any topic that comes up  We go out for dinner or late night fast food a couple of times a week  Some rare moments he gets pensive and tells me his hopes and dreams   something that s unusual for Dan because he s a go with the flow kind of guy who has always said that he doesn t know exactly what he wants to do or be   Part of me feels happy that I get to spend this much time with Dan and that I am the only person he shares so much of himself to  But at the same time I know that he s doing all these things not because I m special to him  but just because I m the convenient option  Lately I ve noticed that I m even adjusting my schedule and plans so I d be free when he s up to talk or hang out  and I hate the fact I know I m selling myself short just to be with someone who doesn t want me   I genuinely want to be there for Dan as the friend he needs now   but I don t want to be the girl who gets gutted in two months when he moves away for work and this all changes  I also still believe it s best for us to stay friends and for him to never know about how I feel  because our friendship and our friend group will never be the same if anyone finds out  But I m hesitant to suddenly distance myself from him because I don t want him to wonder if he did something wrong or ask questions I have to lie to answer   What should I do

335,0,me    m  wondering if to ask out someone else    f Probably cliche or against rules or something  but I made a random throwaway account for this a few minutes ago  Basically  the situation is that I m currently basically best friends with one girl who I met a few months ago and friended through volunteering and tutoring her in physics  However  as I started talking to her she told me once on FaceTime that she didn t really want to date anyone until college  In addition  when I graduate next year I already plan to go to college out of state  since my application is definitely stacked enough where I knowI can go to the my secondary school which is based on the opposite coast  as well as maybe my first which is also on the opposite coast  I do like her  and I was contemplating it before  but I feel like with that it will be very insensitive  In addition  one of her best girl friends has told me that she really wants to date someone  so I m at odds at whether or not to ask because I feel like getting accepted has a good chance  but I don t want to ruin anything because I m going to leave soon  Any help 
336,0,My    M  girlfriend    F  only ever wants to talk about BTS My girlfriend and I have been dating for little short of a year now and we used to game together all the time  Her parents are paying for her college courses so when she failed  a semester her parents made her stop gaming all together  That much I understand  and am fine with  She needs to finish her schooling    Since then though she jumped head first into Kpop and has taken a liking to BTS  I ve tried listening to it and enjoying it with her but kpop just isn t my cup of tea  at least of what she s shown me from BTS   Not only is it the only thing she listens to but it s all she ever wants to talk about  I can appreciate the choreography  artistic  and musical talent it takes for BTS to be as successful as it is  However I m not particularly interested in each members personal life  social media pages or fashion choices  my girlfriend is    I m glad she s found something to be passionate about and I d never discourage her from being so  but it feels like it s all she ever wants to talk about  I ve told her I m not a fan already but she insists on telling me every detail of every members life  I listen and pay attention the best I can but at some point I just dont want to hear about them anymore    I try to talk about things I know we are both interested in  but it ultimately gets cut short by BTS  Again  I don t mind hearing about it but it gets brought up almost every conversation    I dont know what to do really  Are there ways to spark a conversation that I can be interested in as well  I ve thought about telling her this  but I feel it would have an opposite effect to what I want where she would just talk to me less  What do y all think  
337,0,I am so happy for my ex boyfriend and my ex best friend and their relationship together  Do I tell them When I    f  was a freshman sophomore in high school I started dating my high school boyfriend  John  who was the same age as me  so we were both      We ended up dating for     years  During the summer before our senior year  we decided together that it would be best for us to split up and experience senior year as singletons  Our relationship up to that point was extremely constricted due to work and his strict parents  and quite honestly he was an emotional wreck at the time and instead of going to therapy he used me as his deposit machine for his emotions  and as a    year old with my own problems I couldn t handle it  The agreement to split up was mutual    So when we got into senior year  understandably  I freaked out because not only did we share all of our firsts together  but we had the same friend group as well  I still wanted to be with him but he made it very obvious he did not want to be in a relationship with me again  One of the mutual friends we shared  we will call Mary    Mary and I shared choir class together and we grew very close about a year before John and I broke up  We hung out together a lot  and I ended up getting her a job at the restaurant I worked at as well as gave her rides to work every time we shared a shift  We also went to the gym a lot together  Basically  we were very close    After John and I broke up  I still hung out with him and our friend group  Every day after the choir class Mary and I shared  we would all hang out at lunch before the choir class that we all were in  Mary  John  me  and our   friends   We would mess around  watch YouTube videos  and play the piano in one of the choir sub rooms  But I guess it was too awkward having me there because they slowly started to phase me out  I got the hint when one day I was in one of the sub rooms waiting for them to show up for lunch  I waited for about    minutes and when I left the room  I saw that they were all in the sub room next door hanging out and eating lunch  without me   So I took the hint and ate lunch in my car for the rest of the school year    John and I still were kinda talking  but it was awkward  We ended up having sex a few times  we were lonely and kind of missed each other but not really  and this is when I found out that John was dating this girl while he was sleeping with me  so cheating on this girl  THAT was a whole fiasco we won t go into here  After I found out that I was the other woman I cut contact  But that was really hard to do because we still shared our choir class    During the time when the friend group was phasing me out  I was still good friends with Mary and would take her to work  It was one of those things where yes I wanted to be her friend but mostly I wanted inside info on what my ex was up to because we stopped talking  I was immature and hanging on to what  could be a relationship in the future  with my ex  I opened up to Mary a lot about the emotions I was feeling  and one day she straight up told me she was tired of hearing it and didn t want to hear about me being butthurt over my ex anymore   Okay that s fair  I thought  and I stopped talking to her about it and just continued being her friend  taking her to work and getting the inside scoop on what John was up to  Mary and John started getting super close in friendship  and I asked her if there was anything more there and she said  no  I couldn t be with him  he s more like a brother to me     One day while at work  I was on break on my phone and I saw that Mary and John were going to prom together  So at work  like the immature    year old I was  I confronted her about it and she said  I didn t want to tell you because I knew you d get mad   She told me that they were going  as friends  and that it wouldn t be anything more and not to worry  I was still worried and upset  I went to prom by myself   A lot of things happened in between this point and me graduating high school  I dated around on tinder and John and his friends bullied me to the point where I dropped out of our shared choir class and became an office TA  When I delivered notes to the choir room during their class  John and his friend would make pig and cow noises until I left  I ate lunch in my car every day  didn t have any friends because they all stuck around with John  and on top of regular struggles with high school  this caused me to go into a depressive downward spiral    The  day  after I graduated high school  I hopped on a plane and moved across the country to get as far away from John and Mary as I could   I grew as a person and forgot about them  just moved on from the hurt of the break up  the bullying  and the betrayal of my best friend    Its now been almost   years since I moved away  and I have since moved back to a city near my hometown and made a name for myself and my growing business    About   months ago  Mary added me on Facebook  I deleted her when I moved away and when she added me back  I thought what the heck  it s been almost   years since all that shit  and she tried getting close to me again  I thought it was weird and I was still salty with her so I didn t let it go past a few messages    Then  in November  I see on her Facebook timeline that she is in a relationship with John  I was very hurt  Everything that I was scared about between them as a senior rang true  I deleted and blocked them both on everything because I couldn t stand to see them together  It made me sick to my stomach and I was just trying to move on  And at that point I knew that Mary was trying to get close to me again because she wanted me approval on dating John    In January I started getting some energy work  reiki  done and am progressively healing from the terrible emotions I felt from the two of them  I feel like I have truly  cut the cords  that they have on me and have no more ill feelings towards them  No more betrayal from Mary  no more worthlessness from John    I unblocked them on social media s and have seen Mary s posts about the two of them  And they look  so  happy  And I can t help but feel happy for them    I always told John that I would have unconditional love for him  and Mary was my best friend so of course I loved her too at one point  I m happy that they have each other  and that they can heal from their pasts and have a great relationship    I am in a great relationship myself and have no ill contentions with John or Mary  Lately I have been having dreams of hanging out with Mary and telling her that I m happy for her and John  It s such an overwhelming feeling that I just want to share with them  but I feel like if I did I would be completely overstepping my boundaries of the  ex girlfriend   considering none of us have spoken for over a year  I wouldn t want to be friends with them or anything  I would just want to let them know that I m glad we ve all moved on    So this is my question  Do I feel happy for them in silence  or do I reach out to them and tell them I m happy that they are happy  Is it even something I should be entertaining in my head    TDLR  Ex best friend and ex boyfriend are now dating   years after I stopped talking to them seeing them  They hurt me immensely during high school but after some soul searching and healing  I am very happy for them and that they have each other  I want to tell them that I m happy for them but I feel like I would be over stepping my bounds  I also don t want them to think me being happy for them   being friends because I don t want that  I just am simply happy for them  Do I tell them or keep it to myself  
338,0,My    m  crush    f  behaves completely different in texts and in real life and it s driving me crazy   So I met this girl in a bar almost two weeks ago  I started talking to her when she stood next to me  and I felt we connected immediately  We talked for the rest of the night  realized we were living like     Meters apart  so we even went home together  where I tried to give her a kiss  which she declined  but she gave me her number   Since then we saw each almost every other day  just to hang out and have a few beers  talk or go for a walk  It always feels extremely good with her  I know she has fun and that she likes me  and I m super into her  She eventually started letting me kiss her  although rather cautiously and always seemed to make sure that I didn t kiss her as a greeting  The kissing was also rather shy  no full on making out  but it got more every time we met   On wednesday she was at my place for the first time  we had pizza and watched Netflix  Naturally I tried to spice things up and we started to really make out  after her declining to cuddle up at first   things got heated  she definitely ejoyed herself  but eventually she said she had to leave  it was quite late by then so it really was the right decicion    So  normally I d say everything is quite great  except that it feels really  really shitty   There were multiple days where she wouldn t text me for more than    hours  I try to text something nice and cute and after hours she would always only respond with very short and uninspired messages  if at all  Now as far as I observed she is a normal girl when it comes to texting  she s online quite often  she s checking her phone regulary  but for some reason she just doesn t want to text me  and I ll be honest  it punches a hole in my gut  I am just so confused about this behaviour and I really don t know what to make of it   I am sure that this is more than playing hard to get  so I came here  looking for insight and input    Might she have a boyfriend and have like a bad conciousness or something    Are these red flags about her ability to commit and open up  She mentioned several times that her parents really should ve broken up    What the best course of action is from here on  I will ask her about all of this the next time I see her  we re supposed to meet tomorrow  but I haven t from her since yesterday   but who knows what she s gonna feed me   Any ideas suggestions experiences to share 
339,0,How do tell my boyfriend that it hurts my feelings when he doesn t follow through with plans without sounding manipulative and needy Not often  but sometimes  my boyfriend will initiate plans  I guess that s what you could call it   For example  he says   Let s hang out with your mom when she visits  Maybe I can come over and cook dinner   I m not quoting him word for word   These plans don t follow through  seemingly often  Just this week  he asked me how I would feel about a late birthday gift  I told him I would like it  but that it wasn t necessary  He responded with   I know  but I want to   He told me that he wanted to give it to me this weekend  But the next day  he said we aren t doing anything  I can slightly understand why he is apprehensive in this particular instance  but I feel like he s constantly coming up with excuses  It boggles my mind   How do I approach him in a manner that won t sound like I am just getting my expectations up too high  Advice is much appreciated

341,0,Can you have a best close friend of the opposite sex and still have separate romantic relationships I know that s kind of a weird question  but I ve always wondered what it feels like for your best friend to be the opposite sex and whether or not  that makes dating others difficult    Close friends tend to be more trustful of each other  This can lead to intimacy  And I don t mean intimacy as in sex  I mean stuff like sharing secrets and confessions  stuff like that   Here s my main question  How intimate can you be with a friend of the opposite sex while still being platonic  What is the boundary line   Also  can having a best friend of the opposite sex effect your ability to have romantic relationships with others

343,0,I    M  need some final advice on how to approach my problem with my    F  girlfriend and save my relationshipLittle background  a few days back me and my girlfriend got into a conversation that resulted in me blundering out to my girlfriend that she had control over a lot of my emotions aka happiness  I now understand that by saying that  I put pressure on her for the relationship and I came off as needy and clingy which in turn  turned her off  After that day I can tell she was ultimately dry from me  For the first time in our    months of knowing each other  she never needed a towel  We talked about why she was feeling  sad  the next day and she told me that she s just been overwhelmed with everything  shes got a new job and has been working non stop and has to solo carry take care of her puppy and she hasn t seen her friends in over   weeks  which does make sense to me and reassured me that I wasn t any of the reason  I asked her if I was cause I was way into my head  but I now know a reason was that I was being needy and clingy and she doesn t know how to act around me anymore  I was her emotional rock before and I showed a side of me that no woman wants to see in their man  emotional weakness de stability  I took a lot of people s advice and decided to give her space  After her   day journey from Jupiter she messaged me back saying sorry for being distant  During the   days though  I slowly got my life back on track  I remember my purpose and began to love myself again  doing activities I enjoy and doing things to boost my self confidence  I came at her with a more balanced centre  just like how I was when I first attracted her  I gave her some real knowledge while throwing some wit humour into the convo which I can tell she loved  Within an hour it felt like we were back on track and headed into a better playground  Here s my question though  I m not sure how to go about this  I now know what the problem was with me and am in the state of fixing it everyday  my first relationship so bear with me  for myself but I don t know what do in regards to what I said  I want to be her emotional rock again  I want to make her wetter than a bucket of water dumped in the ocean  I was us to be US again but I feel like we should talk and discuss even though she said it had nothing to do with me  Should I tell her next time I see her that  sorry I put so much pressure on you  it wasn t fair to you  talking about my situation  or should we just go about our lives as if none of it happened  I love this woman and I know she loves me  I just don t want things to change with us and I want to be on that loving  amazing feeling we were both on before all of this started  All advice is welcome 
344,0,How do you avoid getting sick when your SO has a contagious illness  Is it inevitable My GF and I are very touchy which I absolutely love  Whenever we are working  we often take breaks to hug and kiss each other and we go to sleep holding each other  I find this to be amazing   However  my only concern is when one of us gets sick  the other becomes sick right away  I honestly don t mind getting sick when she is sick  but when I am sick I don t want to make her sick  My only solutions would be me sleeping elsewhere and not kissing or hugging her when I am sick  but I know she will be against both of these ideas    What has your solution to this predicament been 
345,0,I    F  feel tricked by my  one night stand      M I want to preface this by saying that is not an issue of consent  It is more of an emotional issue in which I feel manipulated and lied to and I would love some other peoples opinions on this situation   I have known this boy  Sam  for a very long time  Occasionally we have been to concerts with groups of friends together  A few weeks ago Sam saw me out at a bar and put in a lot of effort to talk and flirt with me  We had some intimate conversations with some snippets being   our dislike of one night stands  him saying he never finished in a one night stand  sex was better in relationships  etc  Then a few days later he messaged me on facebook and we started talking casually  I invited him to come to a show with my friends in a few weeks and he said he was keen and bought a ticket  He then said he was going out over the weekend to see a DJ and I should come  So i got a ticket for that friday night  During the time before the DJ he offered to pick me up from work  and tried to arrange a time to see me before hand   saying he wanted to hang out with me  either at uni or at coffee or something  In the end we decided on some drinks together before the DJ  He said things during this talk such as  Saying I should help him choose new fish for his tank  and asking if I liked camping and telling me about a camping trip he was wanting to plan   The night went well and I was getting good vibes and I decided to go home with him   From the effort and things he had been saying the week or two prior I thought that he was genuinely interested in me as a person and there could be potential for us to get to know each other better  He also has always seemed like a really genuine and kind person and I didn t think he would hurt me   After we had sex he said that he was free during the week and even offered to invite me to a party he was going to the next night   So i left in the morning thinking things were going well and he was still keen  The next night i messaged him asking if he was out and wanted to meet up  He didn t seem as keen for some reason but I was thinking that he was so keen the night and weeks prior i might ve just been reading the situation wrong  In the end I ended up meeting him back at his and spending the night  We had sex again in the morning  talked for a bit and then he dropped me home  And then BAM that was it  Nothing  He made no effort to talk to me after that  But i thought the signals I had got earlier were good so a few days later I messaged him asking about the show we were supposed to be going to together  He replied   hours later saying he couldn t go anymore because he had a football game  even though its a music show that doesn t start until   am in the morning     So clearly he wants nothing to do with me know and I feel used  confused and hurt by this situation  If he just wanted a one night stand why go to the effort of saying all that other stuff and acting interested  Should i say something to him  Did I read the situation wrong and if so how was I supposed to identify that that s all he wanted

348,0,My boyfriend of two years says he can t date me anymore because of my new job I apologize in advance for format  I m on mobile    First  some important background  My boyfriend and I rent a house together and have been dating for about two years  I m about fifteen years younger than my boyfriend  but it really hasn t been an issue as we are like minded and have a bunch in common  I ve come to terms with the fact that he doesn t want to get married or ever have kids  At first it was a struggle because I m at that age where all my friends are getting married and having kids  but I really love the guy so I m learning to cope and I don t let it affect our relationship    Now to the actual issue  I recently left a job that I was absolutely miserable at       hours a day in the field plus an hour or two of work from home a day  My boyfriend knew how depressed I was getting and he would say things like  I wish you didn t have to take so much work home after such a long day    that sucks you have to worry about work even after you clock out   It was a M F job but I would be taking calls and emails from angry managers and pissed off customers on weekends  I was so stressed that I had trouble sleeping at night and couldn t bring myself to get out of bed in time for work the next morning  On the really bad days  driving on the interstate  I would just hope a car or semi wouldn t see me coming and crash in to me   it was to the point that I d rather be dead than go to work for that company   Anyways  I applied for  and accepted  a job in an industry that I absolutely LOVE  for a small local business that I adore and have supported since they opened  The  job itself isn t exactly ideal  lots of heavy lifting and working in the elements   but it s a step in the right direction and there s room for advancement  Without going in to too many details  I m a sales person for a fairly popular local brewery  Selling and delivering beer to local liquor stores  restaurants  and a few grocery stores  I will also have to serve samples at beer fests and liquor stores  I make more money  left corporate America  and am thrilled about the job    my boyfriend  not so much  This is my first week of work and he s already been distancing himself from me  He says he doesn t want to date a bartender  someone who works at a brewery  or someone who is around  those people  and  that stuff  all the time  I argued that I wasn t a bartender  not that there s anything even wrong with that    but he doesn t see it in any other light  He says he can t explain it but is jealous in a certain way  He said he won t date a bartender and that s that   we went to bed without saying goodnight  without kisses  and with our backs to one another  He left for work this morning and didn t kiss me goodbye    Once he let on that he wasn t going to be dating a bartender  he went on to say we have nothing in common  nothing to talk about ever  which isn t true   he brought up our age gap  he said I was only interested in craft beer and music   he basically dinged me for all of my interests and hobbies  It almost seems like he s using my new job as an excuse to break up with me and I feel like there s more to it than what he s telling me  I just can t believe he s willing to throw two years down the drain  I m hurt   I m willing to give up having a family just to be with this guy  but he can t date me because he thinks I m a bartender  What should I do    I would also like to add that when I found out I got the job  I ugly cried tears of joy  I have to hold back my happy tears when I m driving around working  can t smudge my makeup  p   I happy cry every day after work  I m happy crying right now just thinking about it    
349,0,Me     m  losing my wife     and need advice I am looking for help and advice  My wife and I have been married almost for   yrs  we dated for less than   months before we got married  She had   kids and I had   kids  we now have a   yr together  All the kids are in our house except for every other weekend they go to other parents  When we first got married we both were coming off a divorce over    yrs  we did not know each other before hand   I am in sales and travel ever other week for at least   days  she stays at home with the   yr old and runs the other kids to sports school dance whatever  She has always been the type to take care of herself  so being at home alone is different for her    We were taking the kids to Disney two week ago and before leaving something felt off  I pried it from her that once we got back she wanted to separated  She said that I didn t show her any love  emotion  physical touch  outside of sex  and did not spend time with her  We had our issues and I will be the first one to agree with everything she said    With having   kids at home and it is almost like running a business to get everyone to where they need to go and then trying to make budget work    Is very hard and I focused on that instead of making her happy  She has cried and Ignored her  she has asked to go to a counsel and I said no  she has asked me to spend time with her and I found something else more important  I was wrong in all of that     Since I found out I have done a complete     in how I deal with her  Trying to give her attention  trying to spend time with her  and physical touch  not sexual   but she wants nothing to do with me  She said she does not hate me  but she does not want to be around me and she cannot get out of the thought process that she just wants to leave and I cannot change for the better   I had never hit her  I have never been abusive to her  I have provided a good living for her and my step kids  So when she told me this was it  I went to a counselor immediately  i have read the books he suggested  I have done some soul searching  I am wanting to change to make sure she wants to be married  She is going to a counselor this coming week  but she left for the weekend with another girl that is going through a divorce to a bachelorette party   I am asking for advice on what I can do to keep my marriage together    Please ask questions if there is more info I can give      
350,0,My friend  F  just offered me  M  a threesome with her other friend  F   I am socially awkward and have never had any romantic experience So yeah  as the title suggest  I ve never had any romantic experience whatsoever    I ve never done as much as to even hold someone s hand romantically  let alone date or kiss or snu snu with anyone   Just a couple of minutes ago  my female friend whom I know from school offered me a threesome with one of her friends  this set off a lot of emotions at once    Here s the thing reddit  I dread over my loneliness  It has gotten to the point of superstition and maybe I ve gone crazy too  Human contact is a rarity  so for this girl  who I know so little about reaching me out like this is both intense and scary  but also seems like an opportunity   Now  I have many insecurities  many comprised of wether or not I d be a bad kisser  bad during sex  judged  awkward during intimate moments  things that would haunt me at   AM  so maybe you can see why this is so scary to me  However  it may also be an opportunity to overcome my fears  Mama birds push their youngsters from their nests forcefully to make them fly  otherwise  they die  in a way  my circumstances are as extreme as they come    Should I take this plunge  I ve practically begged for a chance to prove myself  for affection  for love for years  very dreadful years  and alas something is presented to me  something greater than I could swallow  regardless  should I do it anyways 
351,0,Me    M  and my girlfriend    F  went on break  She feels  distant  after almost   months together  This is my first time to post here so sorry for bad everything  My girlfriend let s call her  X  and I had begun dating our first semester of college and everything was amazing we fell stupidly in love with each other and after going on more than a date a day we decided to start dating  We hardly fought at all in the beginning and it was only when school and other activities where putting a large amount of stress on us      For some backstory about our history is that we both had crushes on each other in middle school but when she changed schools we lost track of each other till we both happened to go to the same university where we reconnected during our dates  We have been dating for almost   months with this being my healthiest relationship by far and with a girl I would easily give my life for I care so much about      Now onto where the problems begin  We both have lots of friends of the opposite gender than us but that s just who we connected to more so it really didn t bother either of us till X started a  habit   I call it a habit because it seems as if she s done this before in the past  What she does is before we really decided to date she and I where both on tinder still but I decided that I found the one and so did she but when it came time to ditch our accounts she didn t follow through till I could convince her to  What s more is that she kept the guys she went on dates with before me around and continued to hangout with them  This is where the  Habit  started  She would go over to these guys houses and drink with them and she has another habit of falling asleep after drinking a little for a few hours then she gets up ready to party but it doesn t really matter where she falls asleep  When she got drunk or buzzed she would fall asleep and with her being either naive or just cunning she would always be watching a movie or even stand up comedy  which she hates  with them in their bed and then they would kiss her  put their hands on her and when she realized what was up she would usually contact me to come get her and she would always say that she thought it was me doing it  Another time she and her best friend who we can call  C  where both drunk in her dorm room and she fell asleep and during that time C violated her and she refused to condemn him for his actions because of how powerful his family is she would most likely never get a job in her major if she did      So at this point she had forgiven him but I couldn t anytime soon as I ve had friends and family go through that and I wasn t okay with just letting it slide so I still hold a grudge  Since spring break we knew we wanted to get married but we both knew that it was too soon to settle down and since we where going to one day get married we decided that we should try a few dates with other people just to get the what else is there to offer done with  When I agreed to this I was on pain medicine for after my surgery so I don t really remember much of that week  When we got to school she immediately started going on dates with other people but I found out that she is also kissing them and it really hurts to know that  when we both agreed to this we said no sex with anyone  else  When I go on dates it s really hard to want to go on it because I love her to death and I couldn t imagine kissing someone else other than her so it kills me to know that she seems to not have a care in the world about it  I want to stop the break and keep on loving her and her loving me  She says she loves me and still finds me very attractive but when when we had our fights I would still drop everything and rush to her side if she ever had trouble  I decided to recreate a scenario that had happened to her a few days ago when I had to help her calm down early in the morning  I did what she had done but she just said  try to sleep  or  eat some food  but showed no intention of coming to help me      I have no idea what to do  I love her and can t imagine life without her  How do I fix this

357,0,New relationship  First girlfriend  Need adviceSo i ve      been dating this  first girlfriend  girl      for about a month now and everything s going pretty well  I really like her  i ve taken her out to dinner a few times  met each others parents and all  and our sex is amazing  and not to toot my own horn  but I think I give her the best sex she s had  From handcuffs to doing new positions she s never even thought of before  we are pretty damn freaky  our sex is a big part of made us into a relationship  Also  i m the dominant one in bed  and our sessions last       mins  There is one thing I m concerned about though  is her ex boyfriend she brings up from time to time  She hasn t compared me to him nor does she have anything really good to say about him  mostly just random stuff   but my concern is if she would ever get back with her ex  just out of sheer feelings still being there  If she brings him up obviously she isn t completely over him  Me  being average size            one thing that has shed some light on me is that from what i ve heard that their sex wasn t that great and that his dick is a little small  and they didn t even fuck a lot  Am I overthinking about her getting back with her ex in the future  LADIES  would you rather stay with a new boyfriend who s great in bed  or  out of feelings  would you leave him for an ex you ve been with for   years  who is mediocre in bed  Obviously sex isn t the only thing that matters  but I know for a fact it is one of the most important parts in a relationship 
358,0,I  M    found out a strange secret about my Catholic Grade school  It fills in a blank for myself  Debating if I reach out to my other classmates  M F     I went to a Catholic Elementary  amp  Junior High for     years   In some ways it felt like a normal school   There were strange elements to it  though         Most Catholic Schools are tied to their local Parrish  This one was not   The neighborhood it was in was filled with Senior Citizens and very few families   So it had children coming from diverse economic backgrounds   from upper middle class to below the poverty line  that lived across the metropolitan area     The graduating classes were small         students     Many of the teachers were former nuns  Or nuns   These were open secrets of sorts        Someone revealed to me that the school was created children that the Catholic School District classified as  high risk  students   I m not sure how deep the conspiracy goes   But almost all of the kids at my school        Were victims of a crime   usually relating to their parents      Sons   Daughters of convicted criminals    Had parents with mental health issues    Were adopted and potentially exposed to drugs      Most of the kids at my school were guided by grandparents to attend  Potentially these conversations occurred while they went through therapy with their priests       I lost touch with majority of the students when I went to high school   In a way  a part of me was changed when I left that school   It was never talked about   But subconsciously I knew those kids were going through their own personal hell every day after school       My high school and college experience left me feeling apathetic  I couldn t relate to anyone  amp  stopped being desperate for someone to want to be my friend   In many ways no one ever spelled out that the bond that I had with my friends in junior high was based on the fact that many of us lived in so much fear  amp  unconfusion  
359,0,Should I    M  try to talk to the person I like    F  about what happened while we were drunk or have I waited too long Mobile  first post  sorry if anythings messed up  I always hate anything I ve written and feel like it s not right so some of it probably will look a little off or won t be perfect grammar wise  sorry    I feel like I should preface this with saying that it was nothing big that happened  we just got drunk and made out a lot but still  it was the first time either of us had fully shown intrest in each other  I ve always been interested in her but my awkward ass could never bring myself to say anything  For some bonus context too  we ve known each other since we started secondary school and after we had stopped she asked me  how long has it been   which to me says she s interested    I thought after that had happened I would be able to just talk to her about it and go from there but the thoughts of  what if she doesn t remember  or  what if it was just because we were drunk  filled my head  So I put it off and put it off and it s now a month later and I had decided I was gonna try to talk about it with her but when I tried to talk to her she just left me on read and now I feel like I ve fucked up big time   So mainly my question is do I ask her if I ve fucked up or she s annoyed at me and then try to talk about it or do I just ignore that I ve been left on read  appologize and then tell her that I like her 
360,0,At a loss on what to do  Me  F    and my partner  M    have been together for about a year and a half    He has been through some tough stuff in that year and its has been so stressful for him he s broken up with me several times  Each time no longer than a week that I have taken him back  I love the guy so much that I want to be there for him through it all    Well this whole time I have been emotional  for reasons above and other things going on in my life   I don t take very well to having plans changed last minute or plans being cancelled on me at last minute  I have my own insecurities that I try not to bring into the relationship but sometimes just can t be helped  I have in the past been abused by me ex partner  so I find it hard to figure out how to work this relationship thing  I was single   years before I met my current partner so it s all new    One thing about me is when I am hurt  scared  angry  or upset let it out and cry  I use to hold it all in and one day just lost it  so I try not to bottle things up  But my partner doesn t like me crying  As in he gets angry with me and distances himself from me if I do  Only time he has ever been ok with it was when i found out my kids nana on their dad s side was dying from cancer  So he held me when I cried but that was just the once    So my partner finished up with his stuff that was stressing him out and I was having a tough day yesterday and cried to him  I have been down for a few weeks and I just needed a shoulder to cry on  Well he just told me to stop crying he then decided to have a nap  I was a bit annoyed with that because here I was needing him and I had to go pick up my kids and go back to mine in like    mins so he could have just waited for his nap    I ended up leaving and that night when we talked on phone to say goodnight he just watched TV laughed at what was happening on it and I was annoyed that he couldn t just give me   mins  So I tried talking to him about it but nope doesn t give a crap  He wouldn t talk to me any more and this morning still wasn t talking much to me  Finally we talked on the phone and he was shitty that I was upset and I tried explaining why etc and he just didn t listen  So we planned to hang out tonight once out kids were in bed  I text him that my kids were in bed and that I could come around or he could come here and he then let me know he doesn t want to see me tonight    This happens every time anything happen  He won t see me  And if he does he won t kiss me or hug me  He withholds any love from me  It actually hurts so much    So anyways he doesn t want to see me tonight and i just don t know what to do anymore  I m over the withholding of love  I m over the non support when I need it  I m always there for him when he needs it  I feel used  I feel like I m a child being punished    So my question is    how do I make this better  How do I get him to actually seem like he cares  Because I m at a loss and I m heartbroken
361,0,Post Mutual Breakup  traumatic things happened  help me   F with closure for   MTLDR    days after a mutual  good breakup  I ended up in hospital and was told to have a surgery  false alarm   ex bf only casually texted but never called  never followed up   Hi   Long story short  we broke up     weeks ago   It had nothing to do with our relationship or anything  Last few months  despite several small issues  I  amp  he did feel like we were getting alot closer and our connection was stronger  We started dating in Dec        However  due to family issues  as his parents are super traditional and religious  they want him to date someone from the same country etc etc   we both decided that we needed to part ways because there is no solution for this obstable at the moment  We knew about his parents being against our relationship from the very beginning  but we fought for over a year and to be honest  after a year we start to think about marriage and it seems to be difficult to deal with toxic parents like his   We broke up several times throughout the last        months but this time the breakup felt super peaceful  super mutual for us as both of us have some closure and peace  We decided to meet one last time before the breakup and it went well  Right when I thought to myself I was finally going to let him go and do myself some justice  shit happened   About   days after we decided to no longer continue the relationship  I ended up in the ER  for the first time in my life  due to severe sharp abdominal pain I really thought i was going to die  I was in the ER for     hours cuz the doctors and surgeons thought it was appendicitis  meaning I would have needed a surgery  The moment I was told I needed a surgery  I was so scared I ended up texting both my bff and my ex boyfriend  telling them I was in the ER and might have a surgery  My bff managed to get to hospital right away but I didnt get a text message from my ex boyfriend for   hours and he wasnt online on whatsapp   He turned out to be out of time for work trip  which was fine   but his replies were somewhat concerning and kinda triggered me   He said something like   Hope you have a fast recovery  Hope you feel better  Get well soon  Im in Brisbane for work trip    He didnt sound like he was anxious  worried and concerned for me at all  No phone calls  If i were him  I would be so worried the moment I got the message of  him getting the surgery  and frantically calling him all the time and follow up on the surgery   Nothing  just same casual texts   I ended up not having to do the surgery at all  thank goodness  but I was in hospital for   hours and the abdominal pain lingered for about   days   After that  it has been    days and he never followed up with me on my  surgery   as I never told him I didnt have to have one   I am just so shocked and traumatized how someone can be so heartless and cruel and not care at all  After   days of breakup and he treated me like a stranger  throughout the relationship  he was a nice  gentle guy  not this heartless monster   I would have cared so much for any of my friends who have a surgery  or even for a recent ex boyfriend and I would have rushed to the hospital or just follow up constantly to make sure he is okay   I was so happy with the peaceful breakup  and now Iam just overwhelmed with trauma  bitterness and shock how someone can be such a heartless monster like that  I thought I would have closure and moved on but now Im buried in hatred and disgust  I cant get rid of the disgust I have for him and for me for being with him for so long

363,0,I ve been casually seeing a guy    m   for   weeks his best friend   m  has been fiercely pursuing me So I started seeing this guy  we can call him Jerry  for about   months now  I met him about a year ago on a month long work trip to Cali  We didn t start talking until a few months after the trip the one thing we had in common as our sense of humor  I don t know about y all but that s a big thing for me  Anyways so we messaged each other for about a month  He asked me to come over to his place and hangout  We watched sons of anarchy for hours  It was extremely awkward and we didn t talk much  Somehow this became the only thing we do just hangout and watch tv together  About the  th night we had sex   Sex with him was very different for me  He was extremely quiet the entire time  I later asked him about it he said it s just who he is never been too noisy or well yea  He said it was great for him   Again I don t know about y all but I prefer some subtle cues or feedback for during intimacy  Being passionate is something I enjoy   He seems to just be going through the motions and that in a way translated into everything else in our relationship  We saw each other regularly for about   months where we became a little more comfortable and shared some good moments  we cooked talked about or past  families and everything we enjoy in general  Then that sort of plateaued  We ve only been out in public together twice once we went shopping and the other was tacos for lunch  I love me some tacos  Not once have we been on an actual date  I have a lot of thoughts surrounding all of this    He s afraid to be seen in public with me    He s not too interested    Just wants sex    He s not looking for something serious or just keeping his options open  Another thing that makes me believe he s not too interested is we literally live less than a mile from each other and can comprehend how we only seem to hang out once in a while now  We haven t had sex in   months now and feel like we are becoming more distant  Finally  he doesn t communicate doesn t talk about us or what he wants or likes    Moving in to his best friend  named Will  So Will and I were in a class for work together in February  It s a big class      people  We didn t actually share a class room but I had seen him around  We also work in the same company like Jerry and I however none of us work in the same section  Will is married  has been married for a year  He messaged me the last week of class  giving me praise for speaking up in a meeting on an issue everyone faced while in the course  I new he was Jerry s best friend he had mentioned him several times  I thanked will for the praise on my comment in the meeting and thought that would be the end of the conversation  He continued the conversation asking me more about myself and asked me  would you like to be my friend   Lol thought that was weird I had never been asked so formally to be someone s friend  So we continued to talk about work and the class itself  I felt uneasy about the entire thing we chatted a lot  So I decided to throw Jerry s name into the conversation  Also I felt like Jerry needed to know  I told Jerry his best friend had messaged me and we ve been chatting  He asked what we talked about and then he just responded with ok  Nothing else  Fast forward to last weekend  Will and I had been talking for a few days  we had talked about Jerry a lot  He asked me to get lunch with him last Saturday I had agreed to it  But I got cold feet about it come Saturday  The entire situation put me in a weird spot  Come Sunday asked me to have lunch with him again I agreed to it since he explained he was just trying to get to know me better I seemed like a cool person and he mentioned he knew where he stood in the entire situation and wouldn t try anything  I felt comfortable with that  Sunday during lunch  we sat at the restaurant for   hours talking about everything joking laughing  It was a great time but I kept thinking about Jerry  Wills wife and the entire situation  It seemed so wrong but Will and I had a good connection right off the bat  It was dangerous and I knew it  In the drive back we talked some more we went to a store I needed to stop by before I went home and before he left we talked for yet another     hours  Before he left I sensed a change in the atmosphere   Monday I started my night shift at work  Both Jerry and Will work during the day  Jerry messaged me after a week of not talking  He rarely responds to my text  He asked me what I was doing  I told him I was headed into work  His response was  awe that sucks  I assume he wanted to  hangout   We chatted for a bit then the convo dropped off   Will messaged me if he could swing by and say hi to me at work  I said sure  Will ended up staying for   hours helped me with work and we talked yet again the entire time  He expressed to me that he hated how Jerry treated women and more specifically me  That he can not see how Jerry doesn t pursue me as much  why he doesn t communicate  and why he isn t the one visiting me at work  He expressed what he liked about me and that Jerry s actions don t makes sense  It s seemed to him that Jerry is keeping his options open or just not willing to commit but doesn t understand why since I m  perfect  in wills eyes  Told me I don t deserve that type of treatment  I entirely agree however I did not mention that to him  During lunch Will asked me to drive his car since I had mentioned I wanted to work on driving stick shift  I had a great time and got it on my first try and I could sense Will starring at me the entire time  After he left he mentioned me and said he was catching feelings  He expressed that I seemed soo happy when he was teaching me and he loved that  I m a pretty reserved person and suffer from resting sad face lol  So I suppose me smiling the entire time is pretty noticeable  Since then he s been begging me to spend more time with him    I need help I do not know what to do  I m lost and this situation is astounding to me I ve never been in this position before  What are y all thoughts and suggestions  
364,0,Need help becoming kinkier   I m a    year old guy from the UK  I have a pretty good way with the ladies and have good sex often  But  I just feel like I haven t ventured as far as I could in terms of kinks or wild sexual desire  I need somebody to coach me in terms of trying new things    looking for a female preferably  but if any guys wanna throw in their opinions I m all ears     
365,0,In a weird situation with my ex fiance We were together for a year  but these last few weeks she has been wild drinking with her friends and I have been honest and haven t held my tongue about how this makes me feel   She split up with me  changed her status on social media to  single   told her kids  her ex  my ex friend   her friends that we were no longer together  and I had to break it to her mom   We hooked up last night at her place and it was amazing  but confusing  The kids  that aren t mine  saw me at the house  and I m due to meet her tonight at hers again   What the hell is going on  I m so confused   
366,0,On a break   UPDATE  Thank you for your replies  I just asked him to call me and he did  He said he want to marry me someday but then said he thought he would miss me and doesn t  I asked if he loved me and he said he doesn t know  I feel like he s completely forgotten about our   years together and I m heartbroken    I m writing this because I need to vent and this sub is a good place to do it    So   my bf  of   years  went away for   weeks with his family  Everything had been going good between us  I was really happy with how we were doing  We spend a lot of time together usually so I was looking forward to missing him and seeing him    days into his trip we get into an argument over the phone  it was like  am in the morning for me and   am for him  Long story short  I had finally agreed for a threesome after years of him asking and there was this nice girl we both knew  He wanted to talk about it and we got onto the topic of whether we should talk to her  I was open to doing that for the both of us  but he said he wanted to talk to her  whatever that even means  I said I didn t want him to message her because I am uncomfortable with that  I don t want an emotional connection or relationship with this girl  He said that he didn t want to talk about it until he got back  said goodbye and hung up  I text him why I didn t want this to happen and I questioned whether he had been talking to the girl  he asked me to drop it and because I didn t we had an argument  He started saying  he would f ing talk to her if he wanted to  and he said he wants a break because I m ruining the relationship because I don t listen to him  This argument has happened many times in the past  where I ask him to repeat himself or to clarify something  which I genuienly want to know not because I was ignoring him  But then he seems to get really angry and call me names  Usually all is forgiven within an hour or two but this time he has been ignoring me for a few days  I m trying to make amends but he says I am ruining this relationship by not listening to him  I value his opinion and always take it on board even if I dont follow it  But he always seems to get mad at me if I question anything he says  I don t have anyone to talk to about this  I feel quite empty and confused because I love him and throughout our relationship whatever has happened I ve never cut him off  I thought it could have been a simple conversation not an argument  He might even see this because he knows I post on here sometimes  I just feel alone and not wanted  He is saying that I ll find out whether we are still together when he gets back  Does he even want to be with me anymore  I feel like this is a lot deeper than what s on the surface and I am just so confused  
367,0,Should I go for it I recently started a new job and this girl  Let s call her maddy  Lives there  I m terrible at taking hints so that would explain why I m here  Maddy and I see Each other fairly often and we usually talk every time  I usually initiate the conversation  Last weekend we talked for a couple hours in the evening  A lot of the talk was about her animals and stuff like that  I heard from a co worker that she might have a boyfriend but I m not positive  Where do I go from here  What should I look out for

369,0,Is my boss being a dick to his  challenged  employees My question is not really about relationships but about how to treat people with handicaps   So  because i have some spare time besides my work and my studies  i started volunteering at this bike repair shop charity  just to learn how to fix up bikes cause i have so much fun fixing stuff    They are a charity because their concept is that they teach  kids   ranging between the ages of          with a low IQ and an extreme form of a mental dysfunction like ADHD  autism  trauma s  social anxiety  etc   they call them  people with a distance to the labour market   how to repair bikes  So they offer them classes and hands on experience to be mechanics  while repairing bikes  These people are usually a bit slow at understanding things  don t always know how to respond in social situations and are quite bad at staying on task   Now  today I was talking to my boss  and this girl called amanda walked in  whom in my experience is certainly more socially capable  confident and knows what she s doing than the others   For some reason  my boss just started to say to her things like  you are also not entirely normal  you re also slow to understand things  you re just as challenged as other people here   she replied with things like  but i am not as explosive as Brian  one of the other employees   and I can interact with clients  and I don t get angry for no reason   and he just kept repeating that she was certainly not less challenged than the others and she had a hard time functioning   I felt really bad because it seemed to make her feel insecure  Now  I m not sure if it is necessary to tell  them  that they should not overestimate themselves  but it felt to me a little bit like he wanted to put her down  it made me sad  So  my question is   is it necessary to inform people  like that  they re dysfunctional  or was my boss being a dick 
370,0,My M     BF might have a drinking problemI am F     we moved into an apartment with a room mate a few months ago   He usually drinks five to six pretty strong beers a night   Tonight we had a minor fight and I took a shower he left while I was in the shower  Texted me three hours later to tell me he was going to a friends  I went to bed because I get up around   am for work  Woke up around   am he was sleeping on the couch in the communal space pants around his ankles covered in his own piss  Had to fight with him to get him in the shower after he tried to get into bed covered in piss   Our room mate is out of town so I told him to sleep in that room  so that I could clean the mess and hopefully salvage a few more hours of sleep while I figure things out   He is now yelling and I just don t really know what to do   I don t expect this to get much traction  I just wanted to reach out into the void in hopes someone can help me  
371,0,Trusting Again   Sorry for the long postI  M    have been dating a girl  F    at my university primarily since I met her at orientation  Nearly   years we have been together and I know for sure she has bad abandonment and commitment issues  I dont blame her for it and try my best to always be supportive of her and make her feel beautiful and loved  I love her so much  But that s where the issue starts   A friends of ours found out she was cheating on me  It was out   year anniversary   Now at the time I had my own issues and obviously wasnt the best boyfriend since she needed me  And she told me that she was afraid and started talking to that guy around Christmas   Making it almost a year she had been seeing him and me at the same time  Now everyone makes mistakes   And I always believe in  nd chances so I gave her one  But a whole year   And they did have intimate relations but not intercourse everyone who was in on it explained that they never had sex    That was close to   years ago today and ive recently went on a bad hunch and did something I never wanted too  I took her phone and went through it  I hate being the ever watchful eye due to both of us having bad issues with helicopter parents and foster homes  But I found out that she is still talking to the same guy calling him his nickname that she completely denied ever calling him the first time and about how they missed each other and she was sending videos and nudes to him  I confronted her about it of course and she explains that its not real and that she only does it to keep him off her back and that she just cant lose someone she was close too  she hates ghosting  and ive heard almost too many excuses and sometimes they aren t adding up she has lied to me and cheated on me  I can understand if she wanted to casually date people but why not just break up with me so she could   She is swearing up and down that its over and that she is finally done  same as last time  because he always stresses her out and they fight all the time  What I cant get out of my head were her messages to him they were immense in text and effort and what just felt like genuine feeling and it makes me sick I doubt I can trust her ever again  The advice I ask for is that  Can we as a couple get through this  Or will she just keep doing it  I havent given her an answer and while in my head its obvious  my heart wont let me deal with it so easily  Can I really give her a  rd chance  Do I have to become a type of bf I hate just to ensure the security of my relationship  I just dont know anymore    Long story short  out of   years she has been with another guy for   and idk if I can handle giving her a  rd chance in a relationship after catching her the first time  Thank you so much for reading and getting this far thank you very much please dont upvote so any friends I know might see it  
372,0,Long distance have too much fight with my bf and I feel disconnectedi ve been dating my bf for   years and I feel we have less and less things to talk about and disconnected   We fought too many times and every time I try to break up with him  I really want to  he keeps calling me my phone like a      times until I picked up  It s scary to be called like that  We had tons of conversation about our relationship  heart to heart ones  Doesn t help  He has   from what he said  traumatic relationship experience   of the relationship are all traumatic   It makes me really tired to deal with his past   Two major reason that make me feel hopeless      Today he brought up his EX  telling me he saw his ex s baby pic online he had complex feelings  He told me this because I ask him what he regret about his life  And that was first thing came into his mind  I felt jealous not because the thing he brought up  it is the feeling that he seems very sad every time that he tells me how he got abandoned from someone who he loved and trust  I felt he never moved on  He liked to tell his traumatic stories because he think I am someone who can rely on  I want to help him but I think he should know he need to let go  but it seems really hard for him  To not bring up sad past  which I never did  we promised to not talk about past relationship to each other  I told him this rule many many time  he still can t do it  Just like today      We are long distance    hours flight away  we separated in very early stage of relationship  I was feeling the lowest point of my life and he was the only reliable person I know back then  I trust him a lot  We don t have much of foundation since we started to do this long distance very early  It s been two years now  Everyday talking is very boring for me  I tried to share more things and be positive  But I don t like him being silence on the phone and show his tiredness all the time  We travel every month to each other s cities  And it has been   years and he said he ll move to my city some day  But in the past   months  he didn t get a single interview  I don t see how it gonna work out    Background  Me     F  and my bf     M  meet online though a mutual friend  In the beginning he took it really slow steps to know me and he was being very cautious because his trauma  So we were starting to know each other and going out like once very two to three weeks  After that I went to other city and he said he wants to keep this relationship so I did it too  We never had like a honeymoon phase and he s never like passionate for me from what I felt  First few months he will flew over to see me and when we stayed together in my apartment  we are not very close  no body touch  like cuddling or hugging no in private place and neither in public  the only thing he would do is to hold hands  and we started out fight because of this  I felt he doesn t love me  and he rarely check me out about what I am doing  it s like his eyes doesn t goes to where I go  he s always in his zone thinking something on his own   
373,0,I    F  triggered my boyfriend    M  and sent him into a fit of rage over telling him about my day  TW   Sexual Assault TRIGGER WARNING   This post mentions sexual assault  Also  apologies in advance for my formatting  amp  grammar   I was going to post on AITA but they do not allow posts that mention sexual assault so I was not able to post there     Today I had a family dinner to talk to my brother  sister in law and mother about some family issues relating to the death of my father  My brother and I ended up getting upset with one another and left dinner  He ended up meeting my mother and I at the family home to finish our conversation    I told my brother that he should get a therapist  to help him work through his grief  I explained that I had been seeing a therapist since I was     but my mom was trying to hint to my brother and sister in law that I had more to say     Tell him why you really go to therapy   Well  I knew she didn t mean my depression  I was sexually assaulted when I was       by man who groomed me online for nearly a year    As tactfully as I could  I explained to them what had happened and as a family we derailed our conversation from the previous family matter to this   I didn t want to bring it up and I know I could ve made up literally any other excuse  but it happened and I can t take back my words now    After everything settled down I was able to head back to the apartment I share with my boyfriend  We were chatting and I began to tell him what happened  He has also been sexually assaulted  so it can be very triggering for him to hear things like this  He punched his desk a few times and once I caught on to upsetting him I tried to apologize but he told me to shut up  He stormed off to the bedroom and is refusing to talk to me  I will give him his space   I honestly wasn t thinking about triggering him  as I was just trying to share my feelings about today  I feel bad about triggering him  because I know he won t be comfortable for the next several days  I also feel like I should be allowed to share my feelings though  It s not like I was graphic  I just told him what was said  that my family thinks I should look into filing a report and that I m upset that this was even brought up  I could say that I too am triggered  but in reality I always feel very numb and dissociate after these types of things    He has a lot of misplaced anger towards me for not filing a report when I was younger  but I made the decision not to at the time because my Father would have hunted that person down and likely landed himself a lengthy stay in prison  I wish I could say I was exaggerating but it s honestly the truth  I understand he wasn t able to contact the police because he was young and his parents refused to believe him  His family is also of a different cultural heritage than mine  so the family dynamics are not the same    Am I an asshole for triggering him  What do I do  How can I rectify my mistake and fix this  I am very  numb  to my own emotions as of right now so I don t know how I personally feel     
374,0,Getting sucked into the friend zoneI ve   M  known her    F  for about   months  We met in biology class  We walk to math class together every day  She s kinda cute and got a good personality  I went to her lacrosse game yesterday  and I m not sure how to escalate   is that the right word   the relationship  Any advice 
375,0,I    M  said something strange to my friend    F   Should I apologize Context  I ve been friends with this girl for a few years  We used to flirt in the past  but nothing ever came of that    Today we were talking about tinder  and I told her I m just searching for a  big tiddy goth gf   She told me  I ve been called a big tiddy goth gf before   I took that as maybe she was playfully flirting a little  so I said  When are you going to be my big titty goth gf   I was being mostly facetious  but as all flirting goes  there s always a twinge of truth  She replied with  Oof   And that was it  As far as I know  she doesn t have a boyfriend or anything  I wouldn t have said it if she did  I think she was just uncomfortable and didn t know how to respond   I didn t respond because I was embarrassed  and felt bad if I made her uncomfortable  I don t want to just tell her I was joking  because that sounds like a total copout to a rejection  Should I apologize for possibly making her uncomfortable  Or am I reading too much into it  and should just move on and leave it alone    Thanks for any input 
376,0,I    M  want to ask out a past Tinder match s    F  best friend    F   Is this acceptable For the sake of being anonymous  my past Tinder match s name will be Stephanie  and her friend can be Sarah  Feel free to skip to the last paragraph  I had diarrhea of the fingers on this     amp  x   B   So shortly after moving to this city      months ago   I started spending time with Stephanie  We had been chatting for a couple weeks before my move  and she was okay with having something  casual    which was great for me since I just got out of an engagement   After hanging out the first time  I could tell this was something that would not transcend friendship  Our personalities just did not align  and my type of humor flew over her head constantly    All of this is fine  because we re keeping it casual  After the first  hang   however  she wanted to introduce me to her friend Sarah  so all   of us went out to dinner    To be honest  I kind of wrote Sarah off before even meeting her because I assumed they would be such similar women  Wrong  Every time I attempted banter with Stephanie  and received kind of a blank stare   Sarah was cracking up  Humor is pretty important to me   I like to joke around and just laugh a lot in general    All   of us end up hanging out a couple more times  and stuff like that just continues to add up  Very little conversation actually clicking with Stephanie  but little awesome quirks keep appearing with Sarah    Not the biggest deal  it s not like I would try to go after a woman while I m with someone else   even if it is  casual   But then Stephanie starts trying to plan multiple dates with me  spanning from     months down the road  some of which involve her family  This was a warning sign for me   and nothing against her   I just wasn t mentally nor emotionally prepared for an actual relationship  And even if I was  I would have felt terrible trying to make things work with her knowing I looked forward to our hangouts because of Sarah more so than Stephanie    So  shortly after that I told Stephanie we should stop hanging out romantically because I don t believe we are compatible for a serious relationship  She was pretty upset  but I stressed to her that she was a fantastic person and I would truly love to remain friends  Also  that I know it sucks to hear that line   so I won t aggressively pursue friendship and kind of back off until you decide if that s something you re interested in  And I truly meant it  life is too short and this world is too small to burn bridges    Fast forward   months  Stephanie now has a boyfriend  We chat occasionally  often times it s her sending me a meme that reminds her of me  And I ve seen Sarah on Tinder a few times  but have swiped left because of the off chance that we do match  I don t want to blindside Stephanie and possibly mess with their friendship    amp  x   B    amp  x   B   Jesus  I used to swear I would never be one of these people who write a freaking essay on Reddit  SO  do you folks think it would be acceptable for me to text Stephanie and ask if she would be offended if I ask out Sarah  Or something to that nature  Or would it be better to not do anything  Historically I pursue people fairly aggressively  but I ve never had this particular situation    Thanks for any advice 
377,0,I m   m  feeling apathetic but I know I have feelings for her    f I started talking to this girl about   weeks ago and things are going well  I know I like her she s amazing in every aspect but for some reason even though I know the feelings are there I can t  feel  them  What is this apathy I m feeling right now  The only reasoning I can find is because my last relationship I thought  me and her both thought  I had found the most perfect woman out there and things with her ended very very badly and out of  literally  nowhere  Am I still being affected by this last relationship like I m subconsciously telling myself to not get into another one  Is there any way to move past this state of nothing that I feel  What s going on with me  I m more afraid I m gonna hurt her by unintentionally not feeling anything even though I know the feelings are there  Can someone give me any kind of advice 
378,0,I m sexually unsatisfied with my relationship  even though I believe shes the one for me First post ever from a lurker so be gentle   Some context  My Girlfriend    F  and I    M  have been dating for going onto   months now  We are really close  I ve been a bit of a player in the last   years but I ve never connected with another human like I do with her  We are planning a move to Norway to begin our careers  She wants to be a child psychologist  and I want to pursue Human resources   And before you say it  yes  I do realize planning a future with a young relationship is dangerous but I ve always wanted to live and learn in Norway  and she has citizenship there since she lived there   years ago so the arrangement just made sense   Our relationship is rock solid  Full of laughs  but also mutual care and appreciation  We have yet to have a single argument  I could literally not ask for a better girlfriend  especially since i was in an abusive relationship before her for with a girl who cheated on me constantly for   months  Due to this ex  I have relationship anxiety and I constantly assume the worst of peoples intentions  but my girlfriend has been a constant reminder to persevere through these pervasive thoughts of our relationship  I have absolutely no reason to worry about us  she is loyal  intelligent  funny  beautiful  caring  understanding and a hard worker  She knows my deepest secrets which I ve never told anyone  I have never had this connection with anyone before  She means a lot to me    amp  x   B   Despite my deep love and appreciation for her  I cant help but feel somewhat sexually unsatisfied  Unfortunately  due to my past choices I was acclimated to having multiple partners and never really settling down for long  save for my Ex  and due to this  I have found our sexual connection seems to be losing its stride    times out of    its still enjoyable and I look forward to each experience    TMI     for the first   months the sex was incredible  and frequent  as young relationships tend to go  with both of us having extreme sex drives and feeling satisfied by the end of the sessions  But lately  I cannot shake the feeling our sexual experiences are losing their touch  We do the same positions and movements like a routine  She is not a kinky person with no apparent fetishes or things she wants to try  I have repeatedly asked her and told her I m open to try whatever she wants to  she insists what we do is enough for her and says she doesn t really have any fetish in particular   This is not a big deal as I am not with her for sex  but due to my unnatural sex drive I crave new experiences  I fear our sexual relation is falling into repetition  I have been unable to finish twice now as I d lose the drive halfway through  although this may be due to viewing ungodly amounts of fetishist porn of many different genres  and I am unsure of what I should do to rectify this  We have sat in bed and looked at many differing positions online just to add some flair but she doesn t seem excited about any of them  I fear that my want for new sexual experiences may lead to unfaithfulness  and I have already been feeling an extreme sexual attraction to some of my girl friends  thankfully I have been able to keep this under control and not acted on impulse   The guilt of these feelings really weighs down on me    amp  x   B   Are my fears and feelings about this legitimate  Am I just being a stupid teenager  If not  is there something I can do to try improve this situation  Any help is appreciated    amp  x   B   Edit  spelling mistake

383,0,How do you decide whether to commit to having a family with someone I   m have been dating my gf   f for   years   I think she checks a lot of boxes for me  she s kind  easy going  gets along well with my family  and I enjoy her company   We ve had a few arguments when planning vacations but besides that I feel like our day to day lives are pretty in sync     Potential long term deal breakers are    We both would like to settle down in different places   I d like a bigger family  she would not   I m much more cheap  she likes luxury  we don t really share bank accounts rn so this hasn t been too much of a problem so far   I think I could survive living where she wants  doing the vacations she prefers  and having a smaller family  but I sometimes wonder if maybe there s someone else I could be with that shares my long term goals   There s a part of my that thinks leaving my current relationship would be foolish since things are good  and we have so much trust in each other  it would be hard to find something like this   Since I m younger  I haven t compromised a ton in my life  maybe I m just afraid to compromise in some of those things  IDK   Like how do you know whether it s a good idea to start a family with someone   What are good compromises to make  what potential compromises should be considered deal breakers   
384,0,Bf has ridiculously high sex driveHey there  Just a situation I ve run in to and could use some advice just hear what boys and girls have to say   I m a   F dating a   M  we live together  and our sex life is great   I get him off about   times daily  sometimes as low as   times and max is   times but generally     times a day  Either with my mouth  hand  or sex it happens and it s great no complaints there  I have a high sex drive too so it works for both of us   However on top of all of this my boyfriend continues to masturbate     times a day additionally on top of what we already do  And it hurts  It makes me feel like I m not enough  Like I m always willing  never say no  and am pretty comfortable with whatever he wants to try yet he continues to masturbate   I ve tried to not overthink it but it drives me nuts  He says it s because he has a high sex drive and he doesn t want to bother me because I already get him off so much so he ll just do it himself but I don t get it   We ve talked about it  I ve expressed how it makes me feel  and he always assures me it s nothing personal just his high sex drive   So I want to know your opinion  Am I being crazy and overreacting  Is this normal  Should I let this go or do I have a right to be upset and talk to him more about it  I don t ever want to tell him he can t touch himself because I have no right to do that but I m just trying to find a way where I don t feel inadequate and hurt every time he does it   TLDR  boyfriend and I have sex     times a day and he still masturbates  What do I do  
385,0,Am I overreacting I  F    s  have a friend  M    s  that I met in a running group about a year ago  We are both married and I have never given any indication of being interested in him outside of basic friendship  He s recently mentioned to me that he s having marriage troubles and I feel bad for the guy but never really know what to say when he mentions it outside of things like   I m sorry to hear    I  on the other hand  have a very happy marriage  My husband and I are very open and communicative with each other  We both have friends of the opposite sex and he is never jealous or suspicious of my friends of the opposite sex  nor am I of his  as there is no reason to be and we trust each other fully   This friend and I share a handful of texts throughout the week  Literally maybe      back and forth  Nothing excessive  no full out conversations  We never speak on the phone  and maybe once or twice a month we ll grab a coffee after run group  in which other people are always invited  Sometimes it s just me and someone else  sometimes it s a whole group  and sometimes it s just me and him  but it s never felt inappropriate in any context    Lately  my friend has been making more frequent comments about his unhappy marriage  and it s quite clear that he isn t fully invested in it  despite saying he is and being in marriage counseling and seeing a therapist on his own  I always encourage him to keep working on his marriage as he says that s what he wants  despite making comments like   I don t know if it s going to work   or things about how she s awful to him   But lately  he is starting to stray in his conversations with me when seeking advice  comparing me to her  Things like   I wish I could talk to her like I talk to you   or   It s nice to talk to someone who doesn t yell at me or judge me   and  I text you more than I text my own wife   I responded with   You  can  talk to her like you talk to me  You need to communicate with her    I m sorry to hear that  Just keep trying   and  That s really sad  since we don t even text that often   respectively    In the last few weeks  on top of those comments  he s started to refer to me as  hon  in his texts to me  It makes me feel    icky  I don t like it  My husband says maybe give him the benefit of the doubt  as perhaps he just sees me as a closer friend  than I do him  and it s common for some people to refer to friends they grow closer to with benign pet names  But of course he says to trust my gut and to do what feels right to me    I just feel weird about this new development  I haven t responded to his last text from a few days ago calling me  hon  again  I feel bad for him as he doesn t seem to have many other friends and I m happy to be a friend to him  but don t want to make it awkward if I say something to him about this and it turns out he really isn t trying to push boundaries    But I just can t shake this uneasy feeling about it  None of my other male friends call me by pet names nor have any of them ever made me feel like this  Should I say something to him or should I just start withdrawing  I don t want to ghost him as I feel like ghosting is really disrespectful  but at the same time  I know I don t owe him anything    What would you do in this situation

387,0,My    F  coworker    M  tells me really personal things I don t want to knowI need help  So recently  for some reason  my coworker has started to open up to me  and me alone about some personal things in his life  He just retired from the air force  reserves  and seemed generally okay  Then one day he showed me pictures of him in drag  I was generally supportive  because I love when people express themselves  But the issue is  no one knows he does this  Then he started coming into work wearing women s undergarments under his normal clothes  and would either show me a bra strap or show me pictures of the things he is wearing  not on him  thankfully   It s getting to the point where I really don t want to know about it  and I feel like if this is something he wants to do  he should just do it    I m thankful he opened up to me  as I know it isn t always easy talking about something like that  And I want him to feel comfortable about what he s doing  but I m afraid if I tell him he s making me uncomfortable  it will ruin what he s doing and hinder him actually doing what makes him happy  I m the only person he has told so if I tell someone higher up than me  then I break the trust he gave me in opening up about this    What in the world do I do     Also  I apologize for the formatting and ranty sound of this post    Edit to add  I don t think it has anything to do with him being attracted to me  he s never really made any moves or been really flirty  I think he just feels as though I m someone he can open up to  
388,0,I    F  can t stop hearing the negative in everything  I don t know how to tell a particular thing to my bf    M Although I ve had a lot of luck in my life  wonderful parents who always supported me  I m a naturally pessimistic and negative person  which I will qualify as being realistic   Like many kids  I was bullied when I was younger and when I finally made a stable friend  I started being what I am now   hearing negative stuff in the most basic sentences  I tend to be pretty afraid of people I love abandoning me not actually liking me and just staying with me out of pity or nothing better to do     amp  x   B   I had two relationships that didn t go well at all  My last relationship went pretty well in general  I actually didn t doubt the person s love for me at all  a vast improvement  I ve currently been in a fairly new relationship   a little over   months  I ve learnt more  from previous relationship  about what I want and hope that he knows what he wants in a partner too  because I d like to be with him in the long run     amp  x   B   He s a little shy and a VERY calm person  and it just feels so good to be with someone like that as I feel that my thoughts are like a typhoon  like a balance  Some information here is that he currently lives about  h away from me  and I live in a foreign country far away from my family  this is his country   so we see each other on the week ends  If it happens that he ll say that we can t see each other on the week end because he has a thing that  note  this is what I think   could very well be done during the week  I just can t help but feeling upset     amp  x   B   I really like my job  I teach children and I love teaching my kids   I have a few friends here too  but still  I will feel sad and upset when he tells me we can t see each other and although I won t say it out loud  I m a very bad actress and it s very obvious  There s a lot of other stuff I m pretty annoying about I suppose  but this is the main point where I feel like I m sabotaging myself     amp  x   B   It s always a battle of voices in my head  one side  the smaller one  is getting angry at myself for being so upset for something so minor  it s not a problem to not see each other for   weeks  we ll be all the more excited to see each other after that  that if I continue being how I am he ll probably get tired of me and just leave  But then there s the other voice that argues that if I want to see him yet he doesn t seem to care about skipping week ends here and there    maybe he doesn t love me that much to begin with  And moreover  spending   days a week together when you re       doesn t seem too much to ask for  etc     amp  x   B   Second problem  a long time ago  over    years   I self harmed and I still have the scars on my arms and from what I know  there s no surgery that will completely remove them  I feel like I have to tell him and be honest about the fact that yeah I might not be the most stable person  However these scars are old and haven t done anything like this since     amp  x   B   My  questions        Did anyone go through something similar and managed to stop being so negative pessimistic and start being more trusting and optimistic    ps  I don t really have any fear of him cheating or anything  so it s not trusting in that optic      How should I tell him about that thing I did    years ago   He will notice at some point  How would you feel if your partner were to tell you something like this        Do I sound like an annoying person that should be avoided as a partner   If yes  what  other  steps should I take to become a better partner      amp  x   B 
389,0,Advice about moving in together and whether my girlfriend wants toHey Guys    amp  x   B   I ve been in a relationship with my girlfriend for about two years now   We met before senior year in college  and now we re both working professionals in SF    amp  x   B   For a little more context  we both went to school in Philly  but decided to move out to SF after graduation  partly for work and partly so she could be closer to her family   My family is from the east coast  so that s a bit tough on me   During senior year  about   months of dating   my girlfriend started talking about the idea of moving in together   We weren t going to make any decisions that soon  but I loved the idea and was really excited about that   I was going to stay in school for an extra semester  so when the topic came up again about   months after the first time  it sounded like she wanted to live with roommates for the first year   While this makes sense  I was a little baffled by how she seemed to come to this conclusion on her own  without informing me until the last second  despite hinting at wanting to move in together a couple of times    amp  x   B   But I get it  we ve only been dating for a year to a year and a half  and this is a huge decision    amp  x   B   Fast forward to now   We ve talked about this topic many times now   Several times  she would talk about wanting to move in right away  or right when her lease ends   Then other times  she would have a reason not to  such as that she s worried about doing it before marriage and how it would look if she ended up with someone else    amp  x   B   The other week  we again had a long talk  but this time quite seriously talking about the logistics of moving in together   It sounded like she was really considering this   But not today  again without really telling my straight up what she s thinking or decided  she hints that maybe she doesn t want to move in during her   s  she s    and I m     so that s a pretty crazy statement for me to wrap my mind around   potentially   years before moving in together       amp  x   B   Now  to explain my thinking and why I care about this   I feel like our relationship has progressed constantly since we ve been together  and I feel like we ve grown and continue to grow in so many ways   I love this girl  and I know that I want to be with her   However  I feel like a major next step for us to show our commitment to the relationship would be moving in together   I feel like I ve already made a major step by moving across the country to be with her and apart from my family   In addition  I work in Mountain View  so I m paying about  x the rent I would have to if I lived closer to work  and I commute about     hrs each day to work   I ve made pretty big commitments  and to be honest  it hurts pretty badly that she doesn t seem willing to make a similar commitment    amp  x   B   I feel like this unwillingness for her to commit is causing me to withdraw a bit from the relationship to be honest    amp  x   B   I want to know what you guys think   How should I interpret what she s doing   Is there a certain way that I should bring up my concerns with her   How should this impact how I view our relationship and move forward with her

392,0,My    M  wife    F  has  forbidden  me from donating sperm for my brother  How do I talk to her about this Reposting this here as r relationships mods removed my post for no reason  To the mods here  I am in   no way   asking for  professional legal advice   I am well aware of the laws surrounding sperm donation in my country                          My brother and his wife have been trying to conceive for a while now  and recently found out that my brother is infertile  They ve decided to go the donor route  and in particular they ve asked me to donate since      The waiting list for donors in my country is    years     My brother has no other male relatives and obviously wants his kids to be related to him  When they asked me I said ofcourse and I m happy to help them however I can  However when I told me wife she went ballistic and said I should have consulted her first and then  forbid  me from donating  exact words   She says that she doesn t feel comfortable with another woman having  my  kids and that it would be a very awkward arrangement    WTF  I also think it s extremely hypocritical given she always says  my body my choice  whenever people bring up abortion  Yet somehow this doesn t apply to me as a guy   How should I proceed  Because I really am not prepared to deny my brother children simply because it makes my wife feel  awkward    tl dr  wife is furious I want to donate sperm to my brother and has  forbidden me  from doing so  I think it s completely unreasonable and selfish of her                      Edit  I should mention  my wife and I have three beautiful children already 
393,0,Girlfriend      no longer seems to want to be intimate with me     So we ve been together for about   years  and we never had tons and tons of sex but it used to be pretty regular  Except over the past few months it s been less and less I believe the last time we did  it was the end of January  beginning of February  I ve made many attempts  try to initiate but she never seems to be into it  so I usually just give up  and whenever I ask her about it  she denies it and says she s down whenever pretty much  which clearly is not the case also when I touch her now just like a brush on the back or arm  she gets visibly annoyed  it s starting to take a toll on our relationship  I don t know if my performance is subpar or if she s no longer attracted to me  or attracted to somebody else  or what to really make of any of it  Looking for some advice

395,0,I have a crush on a much older woman and I don t know how to handle it I m   M and she s   F  She s brought up things like sex and how she hasn t had it in a while  I figured she was either over sharing or she wasn t   She also said things to make me think she might be flirting like  age is just a number   she asked if I thought she was ugly and I found myself getting flustered and resisting the urge to say she s cute  and I just said she definitely wasn t ugly  She also said she s fundamentally the same person as when she was about my age  which I found surprising   Just the other day we had a chat on the phone and she s so upbeat and vibrant  for a second I legitimately forgot I was talking to a    year old woman  I saw a picture of her when she was about my age and I was awed at how cute she was  She looks pretty similar still  just older  I got legitimately sad I couldn t have met her when she was my age because she s so vibrant and full of life  empathetic  and beautiful    I m terrified of rejection though so I feel like my feelings for her should dissipate  I considered telling her I thought the picture of her was really cute and   I would have definitely asked you out   Flattering huh   Thanks  I m just feeling awkward over everything     Some commenter said this woman is  quite literally throwing her vagina at me  but ehhh  I don t really believe him 
396,0,I    F  may have just realized I have feelings for my    M  best friendVery long post     TLDR  Just realized I may have feelings for my male best friend of a few years  who I ve never thought of in this way  I m unsure about any of it  wondering if I m still getting over my ex  and have no idea what to do  Help    Obviously just made this account for this post  He may be an even bigger reddit lurker than I  Am going to try to leave a lot of details out because I might die if he read this and realized it was me  Also  English is my first and mostly only language  so feel free to judge away  Maybe don t roast me on it though  I feel kinda vulnerable right now   So my best friend and I went to the movies recently  All of the sudden  a quarter of the way in  it hit me like a mack truck  I can see myself spending the rest of my life with him   A little backstory  We have been best friends for a few years now  we met through a friend while he was dating someone else and instantly became besties without even trying  It was just a fact    I had never really thought of him like that  ever  In fact  in the beginning I really wasn t attracted to him  Slowly  over time  I would notice myself finding little things about him  physically  attractive  Without going into any detail  we have both seen eachother nude more than a few times very rarely in person   and I know without a doubt he is incredibly physically attracted to me  We are  very  similar personality wise  We re both really open minded people  are very open with our sexuality  and have always been incredibly comfortable with eachother  We ve hung out and slept in the same bed a number of times platonically  and I ve never thought twice about it   Over the past few years  many people that I m close with  my sisters  some friends  an ex  have even told me that they assumed we were secretly together fucking the entire time  Our mutual friend has said a few times in the past that it was pretty likely he had feelings for me and I was just like   nah   I was  so  offended every time  because GOD FORBID a man and a woman be platonic best friends  amirite   Yet   here I am  My ex  who was insane  so I never really thought much of it  He would accuse me of fucking any rando walking past at the gas station  etc  even said  you are the ONLY one who doesn t see that you two are going to end up together   But I have had such a hard time getting over my ex    I have been having trouble seeing anyone romantically  and I ve wanted nothing to do with a relationship lately    And then out of nowhere  sitting next to him at the theatre like normal  we are having a great time  and BAM  Am I fucking in love with him   He is the only person I don t mind being around no matter what  even in comfortable silence  I start doing that weird thing where my heart is racing and I m suddenly acutely aware of how rapidly and loudly I m breathing  and I have to  try to quietly  even though it feels like its the loudest sound in the world and he  definitely  hears it and thinks I m insane  take a slow  deep breath to try to catch it  I m somehow aware of every minute movement he makes  and of both of our body language and our shifting of positions  I swear somehow he was even aware of my sudden realization and was leaning closer to me  now  so I m suddenly reading into everything he does  Does he feel the same way  Has he ever  Has he just realized too  Am I supposed to  gasp   tell him    Will this ruin our friendship  Are we soulmates or some shit   GAH   So  my questions are  is this normal for every or most  male female best friend pairs to go through at one point or another   Is this just a confusing part of me getting over my ex  Am I going to change my mind or get over it at some point  Am I insane   I know these questions are likely very hard to answer since none of you know the dynamic and aren t ME  However  I m so incredibly confused and anxious  and I ve also just realized this entire scenario sounds like a tired movie trope   Maybe some of you have been through a similar situation and you got over it  Or you are now living happily ever after  I don t know what I m asking for  really  Anyone have an opinion  I m Ron Burgundy  Help   Edit  felt like I should add that we rarely have secrets from eachother  we mostly tell each other every intimate detail and gross thing and weird thought  And also the fact that when I said I realized I possibly had feelings for him  I mean I actually thought I could see myself marrying him and being a successful couple  And I normally don t stress any of that for my future 
397,0,How to get my ex back   Let me start off by saying I wasn t the best girlfriend   but let me explain     I have bipolar and very rarely  but it happens   I ll have a manic episode  It can last a few days to a few weeks  but in that time I m very hyper  impulsive and just not myself    I was friends with my ex for   years before we started dating  which was last summer       The relationship was very short  but in that time our feelings became very strong and things started moving really fast  He told me that I was the one and that he s never felt this way before about another girl and that he s pretty much felt this way about me from the day he s met me  I felt the same so I told him  Things were going great until a few weeks into our relationship   I had a manic episode that put me in the hospital  During this time my ex was nothing but loving and supportive  yet still I panicked at how fast things were moving and being manic and I just broke up with him  I clearly wasn t in the right mindset  and truly believe that if I was this would have never happened  I think I just felt like I couldn t handle a relationship at the time    He was very upset by the breakup  he cried in front of me and everything  A little while after  I found out that I was pregnant and that he s the father  When I told him he was very supportive about it  excited even  He said he wants be involved and do everything he can to help support and take care of our son  As time went by and my mania wore off  I started to realize how stupid I was and how much I miss him and how deeply in love I am with him  I thought about trying to rekindle things if he was okay with it  but before I got the chance he called me and tells me he s in a relationship with someone and even though I probably don t care he just thought I should know of respect that we re having a child together  Instead of telling him how I felt I just told him I was happy for him  I didn t want to come between their relationship if she was right for him  or could give him better than I did  I didn t want to be selfish so I just held back      months later he breaks up with her and a couple of months after that he brings up to me the idea of us maybe going out to dinner or a movie after the babies born if I m okay with it to see how things go  I never would have thought he d be the one to bring up wanting to work on things again after I hurt him so badly  but I was really happy that he did and I agreed that I thought it would be a good idea  He mentioned this idea   month before the baby would be born  so in one month we d be going out to dinner movie  During this time I see him on social media flirting with other girls    now I know we technically aren t working on things yet or in a relationship   but I let him know that this bothered me and that I found  it disrespectful being that in a month we were about to try to work on things and it just seems like he s not serious about it  He tells me he respects my feelings  but doesn t see how it can be disrespectful to me being that he s single and says maybe right now isn t the time for us to work on things and we should just focus on being good parents and see how things go from there  If that s how he felt I wasn t going to argue with him so I just agreed and said okay   but inside I was really hurt by this  I really thought he was serious and wanted to give things another try but now it just seems like he only sees me as an option now because of my own fault    I just really regret breaking up with him because it seems to me like he may want to work on things because he loves me  but he s really hurt by the past and at the same time he wants to play the field to find someone better who won t hurt him  I don t blame him for wanting to find someone better  but if he was going to give me another chance I think i at least deserved an honest chance  that he took seriously    Now since we ve agreed to not work on things  he s talking to some girl and they ve been talking for a few weeks and things look like they re getting really serious  The baby will be born any day now and I ll have to be around him a lot and I don t know how much of that I can take  knowing that he s with this girl that seems to be so great for him and have so much in common with him  I just want to cry   I wish I never ruined things between us  I just want to find a way to get him back without manipulating anything  What can I do to get him to want to give me another chance  I know he still feels strong feelings towards me  he s just hurt  At the end of the day I just want him to be happy and if it s with that girl  than Id never try to come between them  but they aren t in a relationship yet  and he never knew I wanted to ask for another chance before he did  He doesn t know how strongly I feel and how I will do anything to prove to him I won t repeat the past and I ll do everything I can to give him the love he truly deserves  If he knew all this maybe he would truly want to give me another chance  Since he s still single should I tell him how I feel  Or should I just wait to see if he eventually comes around  I want to tell him how I feel but I m scared  I don t know what to do  Just let him be or tell him how I feel  I believe if somethings meant to be it will be no matter what  so should I just wait on him  Ughhh idk      
398,0,I m still breathing heavyBreathing heavy and frustrated with this whole relationship  Me and my partner have been together   years    of them were easy  A little under a month ago  we moved to a large city we were both interested in  She was definitely pushing harder  Financially  I was and am sinking into a substantial credit card debt  she supported me financially for a year to a year and a half  Throughout the whole relationship  she continuously gives me shared credit cards I didn t ask for  and I end up using out of desperation  I was a shell of a man for that time  instead of self reflection  I chose adderall and weed  I broke up with her while we were living together  and she moved across country     When she reached out to me initially  I was a dick and was emotionless  I hooked up with someone  else on tinder and I told her I didn t until about a month or so after I arrived  she told me she didn t    On the drive over  I was the most emotional I ve ever been  I was coming off of a year of adderall abuse and the suppressed feelings of my mothers passing  I told her  take  lt thedog gt   I dont want to be alive anymore  I never did that  I stayed with her  telling her I didn t want to be in a relationship yet  In this time I downloaded tinder  and undownloaded it  and so on  until I messaged a single  hey    I hear about that the same day and she says she was there to catch me  She used my sexual relationship in our break against me constantly  I understood because I was a dick at many times  However  this whole time  she had slept with someone on that break too  and lying to me so well she could use it as offense    I m now around        in debt  and hear about that when I talk about leaving   In this new city were in now  we had a horrendously stressful move  but after a couple days of unpacking  we had some good consecutive days  we were doing a lot of new activities and she was sexually very forward   After a few days of this  I start to feel guilty for not securing  employment  yet  and I stop wanting to leave the house as much  She isn t happy she has to do these fun exploring  days solo  Next day she goes to get food  it should have taken    minutes there and back  she s gone for an hour and a half  She tells me  the girl who sat next to me complained because it took so long  and she got there after   I think its over explained and fishy  but I leave it alone   For   days after that  every morning we get into screaming matches  every day she was gone for hours at a similar time midday   Everytime  she d come back asking why I was still mad from earlier     days ago  we repeated that cycle  but this time she goes out drinking solo after  She comes home fairly intoxicated but acting like it was life threatening  Asking some variation of  is she going to die  for hours  I was distant yesterday  and she talked my paranoia down last night  we ended up having dirty sex in a chair  something she had never done   Today  I was supposed to wake her at      but after trying   times at least  I give up  She was up at     am  screams at me for making her waste her day   I cant count on you for anything   Poof  Gone within    minutes of having  her in the same room  I call her    minutes  later because I m beyond paranoid at this point  She says x and y are where I m at  check the map  So I pulled up  maps and saw a timeline feature  there was a central location she went to for a long time every time   I then checked the myactivity link  I saw that she had downloaded tinder twice  The same day as the fighting and drinking  I understood she was investigating because of our high tension relationship lately  She downloaded tinder on the day the food took forever though  and things were rosy then  She also downloaded bumble   Some other details I left out    There hasn t been one suspicious thing I ve found  where she doesn t deflect towards me     started wearing a new wardrobe style right as we moved   shes eating half much and dropping weight like crazy   said her ex was extremely abusive  a couple weeks into our relationship Im sitting on her porch  and she was    minutes late  She said she saw her ex and they screamed st each other at a crosswalk  I immediately knew it was bs  a couple months later it came out that she came inside and smoked weed and drank a beer with him  just to make sure there school university  organization wasn t going to be awkward     on her Google history  it said there was a text message at  am  that night there was a bed made in the living room when I woke up  and she says it must be an update  or something  she  doesn t delete   I m now at about        in debt and reminded at any disagreement  and I m a waiter   I just want to hear if this sounds like my paranoia  or circumstantial enough to leave    
399,0,My brother is about to propose  I think he is in an unhealthy potentially abusive relationship  Do I say anything Throwaway bc my brother and I used to be really close and he knows my account    My  F    younger brother  M    is preparing to propose to his girlfriend of   years  I have some biases about her  I m not going to lie  but ever since they got together my brother has changed  And not just the normal changes young people go through when they fall in love   His core morals and beliefs have shifted  he attempted to cut ties with my grandparents and parents  who gave us an amazing childhood   has pushed me away  I found out through the grapevine that he was going to propose   developed multiple mental health issues  and has adopted odd speech patterns    On top of this  his once life goals were completely erased and changed to hers  He no longer wants to adopt have kids  doesn t want to travel outside of the U S  or become a partner of his current law firm  no longer shares his old political views and has adopted a left extremist reality  thinks all White people are bad  he s White she s not   will tell you he can t talk unless she is on the phone with him  and will take her name when they marry  due to him being the only man in this generation  him passing down the family name has always been part of his identity   They have been living together for   year and he also pays all the bills while she doesn t even look for a job  For the past   years he also only smiles in photos of him with her or her family  Any pictures with me or our family looks like he is soulless    I get that not everything listed above is bad  but I can t shake these as important things    I get that adult siblings loose touch and people shift with their significant other but he is a totally different person when he is alone versus around her  When they are together they love their PDA  something he used to despise  and are overly aware of consent  I m all for consent  don t get me wrong  but it gives me the heebyjeebes when he asks permission to look at her when she is speaking  He is    and like a puppy dog heeling beside her  They both talk like a precocious   year old that has a college degree and have such weird ass vibes everyone is afraid to say something to upset them and potentially have them erase us from their lives  When he is around me without her he will revert back to his normal speech patterns  smile  laugh  and get along with family     They also have had multiple fights where she threatens to kick him out and refuses to talk to him for days when he forgets to feed water their cat  I don t think he should marry her if they are currently unstable  He has also emailed me and told me that he thinks he is unworthy of anyone s love if not hers  He recently began to suffer from severe depression and has been suicidal in the past few months and she has her own serious health problems  I know people can lean on their significant others and become stronger  I overcame addiction with my beautiful husband   but they just seem like it will eventually destroy them  Like I think my brother may die    I feel almost like it s my duty to speak out since no one else wants to lose their only son grandson over it but at the same time I m scared to say anything to push him over the edge  Our younger sister was a punk ass kid and dated men twice her age and rebelled even harder when we told her to get her life together    Idk  I m sorry this is so sloppy  I ve taken the past few days off of work and just don t know what to do  I feel like either way I may loose my brother   Has anyone told you you were in an unhealthy relationship before  Did it help you realize things were wrong or did you end up hating that person    Any advice will help      
400,0,Awkward  LDR  relationship after   month split with my    M  ex girlfriend    F  gt TL DR  After making contact with my ex again post  nd split  she friendzoned me  behaves like a couple  asks  me favors  expects me to entertain her  but talks to me as a friend and dodges conversations about potentially  becoming a couple again    EDIT  My apologies for the double  relationship  in the title  We ve had a long distance relationship for the past   and     years  this was also my first ever serious relationship with someone  Needless to say  it was extremely rough  despite loving her to death I am extremely insecure about cheating  to the point where I make myself believe it should be legally punishable  Before any splits happened  we wouldn t be able to stop talking to each other  being it a long distance relationship  everything was through texts or calls  Half year into our relationship we had exchanged over    k text messages each with thousands of pictures sent  It was the most profound amazing experience in my life  I couldn t have been happier  However  this came with a price  being the jealous person I am on top of it being an LDR  we have had fights every     days on average  The fights were usually either silly arguments or one of us suspecting something  My lack of experience in relationships compared to her having    past relationships on top of having a child with one of her ex es that she is forced to see every other day  because of the child  made it extremely hard for me to keep trusting her   We split up   times  the first time was last summer  I ended our relationship and broke all contact with her because I felt like I couldn t make her happy and jealousy was driving me insane  After   agonizing months of me constantly craving her  occasionally checking on her online profiles  I decided I ll add her and keep it as  friends only  which she agreed to  Shortly after  we were back at it again as a couple  I also got over my jealousy for most of her past friends  ex es and whoever I got jealous about before we split  So  everything was going great the  nd time around  however she started playing a status farming mobile game with a party theme  I don t know if I m allowed to name the game but the initials are PIMD   This has put me on edge  whenever I didn t have time for her  or she wouldn t be interested in doing something together  she would spend time with friends on that game  I feel like this has snowballed to a point where she made that game more important than anything else  her entire character  gradually changed  she became less talkative  I was lucky to exchange a few messages per day  no good mornings or good nights anymore  nothing  we went from   k texts mo to like    k at best  note this is STILL waay more than the average couple   Her character didn t really change that much before our first split  it was mainly me who just couldn t take my own insecurities anymore  However  this time around she felt completely offput by anything I would tell her  everything she said to me felt condescending and rude  This has made me insanely jealous as I found no rational reason for her to change personality in such a drastic negative way other than flirting emotionally bonding with someone else  Whenever I would remark about her drastic change in personality she would give me the ultimatum of  if you don t like it you can leave   I felt so helpless  I have had days without eating a crumb  I contemplated suicide and said absolutely terrible things to her  This scenario repeated itself hundreds of times until she had enough and broke all contact once again   While the  nd breakup wasn t as devastating as the first one  it still felt so wrong  unless I was busy all day long  a simple   minute idle time would trigger thousands of  what if s  and  what could ve been s   After both times we broke up  it felt super unnecessary  felt like everything could ve worked out if this and that  Both times I got the same realization that I never really found anything suspicious and I was being irrationally jealous  After the  nd split I also realized that the whole personality change  the extreme decrease in interest and activity with me was because I would always somehow twist whatever she says into something suspicious  She still loved me  she still wanted to be with me  but all the things she wanted to talk about or do with me would raise me some form of suspicion     Months later  around a week ago   once again couldn t bare missing her anymore  decided to text her  Big surprise  blazing fast reply with an entire bible of the things that happened to her while we were split  She still plays that game most of the time during the day  it s still hard to get her attention  and I still feel like she barely cares about my existence  I also tried to bring up getting back together again  but this time she brushed it off  she didn t seem fond of giving this couple thing another go or at least not yet   This has left me majorly confused  I feel like she is in the same position as me  she still loves me  she wants me around  she behaves with me as if we are a couple  asks me to watch movies series with her at night and so on  The major issue I have right now is that she behaves as if we are a couple but talks to me as if we are friends  This means that she expects me to entertain her  do her favors etc but whenever I try to really approach her emotionally she backs off  I am once again stuck in a void  this time it s an awkward friendzone   I have no idea what to do  I love her to death  I always will  I made it a vow in the beginning of our relationship to never leave her for someone else  that one day I will marry her  All my friends tell me it s not worth it  my mom is telling me I m being abused  I have tortured my mental and physical health for this relationship to a point where I feel like I depend on it and I can t escape  What do I do

401,0,My    m  girlfriend    f  refuses to end arguments we disagree on My girlfriend and I have been dating for   months  things seem to always be really great between us until we have disagreements   We are planning to move in with each other next week  Last night she brought up an issue where she perceives that I m not moving stuff fast enough  I disagree with this as I ve taken multiple trips  and as of this post  we have roughly   boxes left of things  a couch  and a matress  and   days to do so   I talked with her about the problem  and I said I didn t think it was that big of an issue  because we have time  and there s such a small amount of stuff left  She wasn t satisfied and felt as if I was dismissing her  so we ended up outlining a plan where we would move everything we could before hand  and move the rest with the moving truck   days from now   She wanted me admit that I had been lazy  and wasn t satisfied with the resolution  I refused to admit to that  and we went back and forth for about    minutes of literally repeating this back and forth   This is a theme of our arguments  we will often disagree  both state our respective sides  and this is where the main issue arises  I recognize that we have both communicated our sides and that we simply disagree and no more communication will happen  I will generally tell her this  and as a means to end the conflict say that I ll let her repeat her point and get the last word in  I listen  and instead of jumping into disagreement  I ll generally just end with  alright I understand your issue    Which is true  I can understand  I just disagree   She refuses to accept this as a resolution and says that I m only doing it to shut her up  She says that in her culture  Indian  when people disagree  they sit down and work through it until both partners are satisfied with the resolution   I view this is unhealthy  because I tend to feel like disagreements in relationships are ok  and that it s ok to walk away from an argument and talk about it when you are less heated  When I do this in am attempt for space though  it s often met with her saying that she s deeply concerned I don t care enough to keep arguing until my partner is satisfied with the resolution   Am I wrong here  What can I do to help her see my point of view 
402,0,Me   M  and my crush   F  confessed our feelings to each other and now things are awkward   A couple days ago we kissed and admitted we liked each other and ever since then it feels like the spark is gone and I don t know what to do  I am NOT ready to give up on this relationship as it is 
403,0,Me    F  and my boyfriend    M  of     years have not been intimate for almost   years now Hi  before we go into the story I just want to say that I love my boyfriend and have always and will support him in and through everything  I just want to  maybe  vent and try to get someone else s views on this that do not know either of us  Like an outsiders point of view    So my boyfriend and I have been dating for     years  We met at university while I was doing my masters and he s just completing his bachelors  We hit off instantly and were always talking and chatting and then   months into knowing him  I asked him out and we ve been inseparable since   Everything was going good and we were going pretty slow as I m his first girlfriend and he s been rejected before by the only girl he asked out   For reference he s not my first boyfriend   Around   months into the relationship I had moved to another city for an internship for   months  We continued in a long distance and visited each other between semester breaks and birthdays  Before I left for my internship  we started getting a bit physical and intimate  We didn t have sex  and haven t had it yet as we both aren t ready for that  but we did make out like teenagers and fool around a bit  Somewhere between the time I left for my internship and me visiting him for his birthday  around   months  he stopped being intimate completely  He wouldn t kiss me  nor would he initiate any physical touch between us  For example  if I sat in the car with him  he would no longer rest his hand on my thigh or at the back of my neck   Observing this  I asked him about it and tried to find out if it was something I did or had something happened that caused this sudden change  He kept denying that anything was wrong and that he just didn t feel like it  I left it immediately and didn t bother him with this topic again  thinking that if he d like to talk about it he would let me know  We have pretty good communication between us and we both feel comfortable talking to each other about anything and everything   Fast forward to me returning from my internship and I thought maybe now that its no longer a LD  he would be more intimate  But I was wrong and he still wouldn t initiate any physical intimacy between us  After many talks  he finally opened up about feeling anxious in doing the acts and that he felt he wasn t ready to take the relationship to the next step  I appreciated him telling me this and that if I ever do anything to make him uncomfortable to please tell me so I can stop immediately  We stopped having any intimacy  maybe a few pecks here and there but other than that zilch   This was all about a year and half ago and we still have no intimacy    The reason I m venting is because for me intimacy is a big thing in a relationship  To feel wanted not only emotionally but physically makes me feel valued and comfortable  I have been able to put these needs aside as he works out with his anxiety and issues but all I want to know is how would I be able to help him  I really want to be supportive and I m at a loss at how  I don t want to pressurize him into something he d be uncomfortable doing  but would do it for me  Nor do I want him to feel that because of this  I would leave him  I love him  and I want to be with him no matter what     T L  D R  my boyfriend of     years hasn t been intimate with me and I can t seem to understand why nor do I know how to help him    If you have any advice or suggestions that I could try  please let me know    Thanks

405,0,I    f don t want my boyfriend    m to meet my mom Ive always been pretty close to my mom and when I was younger it seemed like she could do no wrong  As I ve gotten older though  I ve noticed a lot of toxic traits that she has and it s made me distance myself from her   I ve been dating my boyfriend for   months and he s mentioned a few times that he would like for me to meet his parents and he would like to meet my mom  I m very excited to meet his parents because they sound wonderful  However  I m not too excited for him to meet my mom   My mom is gossipy  judgmental  negative and rude  A few examples of her behavior    At a wedding while the bride was walking down the aisle my mom whispered very loudly to me  you know his mother can t stand her   Of course I was mortified that she said that and even more upset that everyone heard   She is frequently negative about my siblings relationships marriages and talks down on their SOs  So I can only imagine what she has said about my past partners to my siblings   She is overly critical of anyone I date and even told me she thought the last guy I dated was  slow  or  off   She frequently talks over people or if she does let them talk she ll ignore what they said and steer the conversation towards herself   I care about my boyfriend and I let him in on every part of my life but I m dreading him meeting my mom  I know meeting her is important to him but I don t know what to do  Should I tell my boyfriend how toxic my mom is  Should I just suck it up and let him meet her and suffer her judgement later  Any advice   I m sorry if this is too long  This definitely turned into a vent session too  
406,0,Fwb advice Ok so I ve   f   been fwb with this guy    m  that has expressed interest in a girl which I m totally fine with  he told me we can continue to have sex until they start talking well we just had sex today and after we were talking and I asked him if the girl would get mad if she found out he had just had sex a couple days ago with a girl and he said yeah but she s not gonna find out  Deep down I feel like it s kinda wrong he s literally sleeping over at her house Saturday and the fact we had sex   days prior is just weird to me especially when he talks about how sad it is that it s ending 
407,0,I    M  am interested in my co worker    F  but shes mostly gay and its complicated TLDR  I have feelings and can t tell how to proceed based on multiple aspects and not wanting to lose a potential friend  also not wanting to miss an opportunity for more    I m having a real hard time reading this situation  Basically been chilling with her and her other friend  who she says is her platonic soul mate and is one of her roommates  for about a week  I ve already slept over there twice and we cuddled all night last night    She doesn t say anything about my flirting but we ve both been being super sweet to each other and texting alot  There s some sort of energy for sure  I know she s had ex s that are dicks that abused her and are giving men a bad rep lol and she s into chicks  But I have caught a vibe I haven t felt since my first love like I m interested in her  Those crush butterflies    So I wanna be careful how i act to not have things get weird or something    There s a few more factors  if it turned out things weren t going anywhere I d be okay with friends cus I like the whole house there  the roommates are all cool and it s my scene and I ve needed to chill with new people  but I would probably have to get over getting in the friend zone  But it s early enough for me to try to not be put there  lmao then the other thing is she drinks and does drugs which I have occasionally been doing the past few months but was sober for about a year and wouldn t wanna do them alot  but we just did some last night     So i dunno if I should make a move  if I don t I ll probably regret not trying but if it doesn t go anywhere I d wanna be friends and if it did go somewhere I dunno how serious I would wanna be since we re Young and the drug and friends aspects  But I don t wanna ignore my intuition which is saying we are kindred spirits  What advice do you have

409,0,I  m    told of my gf s      father for being an ass and now I m the bad guyI work at my gf s family taphouse bar and and normally get along with the parents just fine despite them being very conservative and me very much not  We ve been together for about seven years now  we met in highschool  so nothing is a surprise but a strange incident happened in the last few days  The father  let s call him Bob  knowing my political views very excitedly asked me about the mueller report and I said my side of things which he didn t agree with but whatever I figured that s that let s move on  But Bob kept coming up to me and pushing the subject over and over  I bounced back and forth between trying to give my perspective and just ignoring him but he wouldn t have it  Again I ve known Bob for   years  so it s not like we are just getting to know each other  But he kept pushing and pushing me   Fast forward to today  As I m chatting with a customer at my gf s family bar  Bob walks in the front door and right away asks the customer if he s a trump guy or not  Customer is a little confused and gives sort of a non answer and then Bob continues to talk to me about trump shit  I have to say I am a person that is very invested in politics but I don t make it my business to evangelize my beliefs to others  especially in a professional setting  Yet here I am  I say a few things but in the end try to deflect and ignore it all  no but Bob won t have it  He literally blocks me from leaving while I m doing other shit and to remind you I m on the clock trying to run a kitchen and a bar at the same time   Bob keeps coming up to me throughout the night talking about how he doesn t like trump but blah blah Bible passage whatever  And something he does which is critical to this story is every time he speaks to me he would chuckle and Pat me on the shoulder  Super disrespectful and super patronizing imo  And I got sick of it  I ve been with his daughter for   years I ve been around his wife and other children for the same amount of time and he can t even give me the basic respect of treating me like a grown fucking adult    So I told him nicely  I said Bob I don t like the way you talk to me  I don t like when I say something you chuckle and Pat me on the shoulder  It doesn t make me feel good when you do that   His response was   are you gonna cry about it   Now I genuinely believe he wasmt trying to be an asshole  I know he was uncomfortable not sure what to say and trying to be funny and didn t have any hate in his heart when he said that  just a distasteful ill timed joke  But I sure didn t think it was funny  And I said so   Bob I don t think this is funny    He sort of said whatever and we pretty much left it at that  Came home to my gf s place and against my better judgement I felt like I needed to talk her how her father was treating me  I knew she would be upset  she hates conflict and gets pissed at anyone that starts it  But I feel like this is something that needed to be shared and make her aware of  We ve been together for long enough that we should be talking about these things together  But as I sort of expected she s pissed off at me for creating conflict  An issue which I didn t ask for  An issue that I tried my best to ignore and disengage from  But now I m the bad guy and she won t talk to me    I know what I said was a little risky but I feel like I need to stand up for myself  Her father says he likes me but I don t think he respects me and I feel like  for better or worse and wether I did it in the right way or wrong way  tried to tell him I want some respect   I m not sure what I m trying to get out of this post besides maybe some advice or perspective  This woman is the person I want to spend my life with but her family seems to get a pass on behavior I would never let my family do 
410,0,I  F  am considering asking my stepdad if I can call him  dad My mom and stepdad have been together since I was a kid  I m an adult now  He is very sweet and we are close  I love him very much and I think it would be nice to signify that by giving him the appropriate title  My biological dad is also in my life and we have a great father daughter relationship  this isn t to slight him but rather to respect the relationship that has naturally developed with my stepdad  I am not someone who shows emotions outwardly so I m REALLY nervous about asking because the thought of a communal feelfest is extremely foreign  Not bad  just not something I m used to  and uncharted territory is scary  Has anyone asked this question before  Any recommendations on how to broach the subject what to say  Any stepdads out there who could give insight on what you would think about being asked this question   ETA  my mom has told me that he always really wanted children but they got married too late in life so he doesn t have any biological kids of his own  This makes the situation even more emotional   E   for everyone saying  don t ask  just do it   I m really not comfortable with that  If I m going to do it there needs to be a conversation first  
411,0,When should I tell my current my boyfriend that I have an abusive ex husband I got married really young and got divorced way  before I met my current boyfriend  My boyfriend is really sweet and we love each other  He knows I have a shitty ex but he does not know that we were married or that I almost had my ex husbands baby I got an abortion    I told myself that the next person I would tell these things to would be the person that I marry forever because my ex was very abusive  Now I feel like I am telling a big  lie    Is it important that I tell him these details of my life  And when should I tell him  
412,0,How do I find out if she s single or taken without hinting that I m into her I thought about just asking for her number then getting to know her a little better before asking her out but I m scared about asking her directly if she s single  I m not afraid of asking her out on a date but I just don t wanna be heart broken from rejection  I think she could be the one but she keeps sending mixed signals  How do I find out if she s into me  And can I find out she s single  
413,0,I    f  don t want to be a bridesmaid to my    f  friend because my friendship with another bridesmaid    f  ended badly So about   years ago I was actually maid of honor to the second friend i mentioned    f  let s call her  A   Some months after her wedding there was a party at her house where i got pretty drunk  I dont remember much but I do recall being frustrated and crying about it  and our friendship was in my list of complaints   A  didn t like that I got drunk or what I said while I was under the influence  she doesn t drink   I tried to apologize face to face  tried phone calls  and even text messages but I was ignored  The friend who is getting married this time    f   I ll call her  B   was there to witness the whole thing   A few weeks later my sister got married and she was invited  we ignored each other throughout the whole thing  But just as my dad was giving an emotive speech  A   kept giggling and talking loudly  so I had enough  Told her to shut the fuck up and spit out her full name the way a mother does  the whole table just stared shockingly at me  Haven t seen each other since and I dont want or plan to fix that relationship   This week  B  asked me to be her bridesmaid and I said yes thinking I wouldn t see much of  A  because since she is married she can t be one  right  Well  nobody cares about that anymore and she is also a bridesmaid    Honestly  I haven t been around that circle of friends for years and the last time i spoke to  B  was a out a year ago  I m afraid I ll practically  be a stranger there and since I m introverted it is an anxiety trigger for me   I don t want to be rude and back out  but I also don t want to care about this people anymore    Should I go to the wedding 
414,0,Messaging a girl on InstagramI   m  messaged this    f  on Instagram a couple days ago  not a supermodel or anything  just a regular girl that lives in the same city as me  I stumbled on her page by happenstance and we seemed to have a LOT in common and she was extremely attractive to me  so I felt absolutely compelled to befriend her  not really looking for a relationship due to age difference   Safe to say she didn t reply whatsoever  and by the lack of a  seen  status it seems she didn t even open my message  She only has half a thousand followers and     likes per photo  so I doubt it s a case of having tons of guys messaging her daily  and she updates her story frequently so she s definitely aware of the message  I feel pretty shitty about not getting a reply and I want to know how bad of an idea would it be to send another message to elicit a response  Really into this girl and it feels like a missed opportunity  
415,0,I m    F  worried telling my friend    M  will ruin his chance to be happyMe and my friend have known each other for about five years now  About halfway into that time he told me he had feelings for me but I didn t return them  Down the road I realized I had feelings for him but we were both dating people so I kept it to myself  Later on we had a falling out and during that time I ended up sort of admitting I had feelings  We ve gotten back in touch a few months ago after he reached out  About a month ago I saw him post on here about me and how to get back to where we used to be friendship wise and how to maybe move onto more  He also in the past said he was in love with me  I ve been trying to kind of take things slow because i got really hurt last time we fought and I m trying to avoid that  I would absolutely love to try a romantic relationship with him eventually though    Recently I ve seen him post some stuff on social media that makes it seem like he might be involved with someone else but it s vague enough it could be about me  I m worried now if I say anything I might mess with whatever else he could have going on and that s the last thing I want to do  If he s happy with someone I don t want to intrude on that  I tried to ask a close friend of his if he was seeing anyone but they said I should ask him  Which I thought might be a good sign for me but I also don t know if they know that he had feelings for me  I m just kind of at a loss for what to do now  I don t want to miss my chance but I also don t want to ruin anything that s going on with him and someone else

418,0,Deep down I feel like she cheated on me  It I have no proofThis is a long story  And this happens almost a year ago  I m a   m and been with my   fm girlfriend for almost   years now  There was an instance one night when I woke up at  am with the gut feeling that my girlfriend was not home and was with another man   Here we go    I was at work at the time  I was super busy and haven t talked to my girlfriend all day  When I got home I called her  I said hey how s it going  Must of been around     pm  She was still at work  I said hey I was gonna go out and grab food  Let s meet up  She said ok  I said cool I ll get myself together  We hung up and then she text me shortly after and said  I m gonna just go home  I think I hit the wall    I texted her back and said ok well feel better or whatever  She got home and texted me again  She said that she was gonna go to sleep and that I better let her sleep if she wants me to be ready to meet my friend in town tomorrow  My friend was visiting and he was gonna meet her for the first time  So I texted her back and said cool  It was around  am when I woke up nervous with butterflies in my stomach  I instantly thought of her and my gut told me to go to her house  It told me that she wasn t home   I didn t want to believe it but this never ever happened to me before  So I took a train to Her place which is about   min away  At the time I lived in the suburbs and her the city  When I arrived to her apartment it was around     am  She leaves every morning at  am sharp to be to work at     am  I admit that I was stalking by her house  I had to do this as my gut told me to go and see what was up  I didn t call her or text her  I just waited to see if she would leave her house  And she never left  It was      and I didn t see her leave  I went to the door and rang her bell  She didn t answer at all  My heart was torn at this moment as I first came to the realization that what I experienced at  am that morning was true  although I had no evidence    Later in the day when we met I asked how her day went  I then asked her if it was raining when she left her house for work this morning since it was raining while I was standing outside down the block  She said no it wasn t  Right there I knew that was a lie  Idk what to really think and do it this  It s been almost a year since this has happened and I still think about it this day    I remember a while back when we were dating seeing a guy call her phone named Marlon  We were out together one time and I asked who he was and she said it was someone she said had questions about how a logo of his looked  Some BS  But this was before my incident had happened    Since this incident we have traveled to over   countries together  moved in together and are enjoying life  Little does she know what is lingering around in my head  I still get subconsciously weak when she is texting and posting on social media  I instantly think that she s seeking attention from guys  Although this may sound a bit crazy  and trust me I agree  I think a lot of this constituted from what happens that night at  am and the actions I took  Idk what to do  Either burry it  or tell her in all honesty what had happened that night  I am not prepared for the worst

421,0,My  F    boyfriends  M    low self confidence leads to less sex  How can i help him English is not my origin language so please excuse mistakes   My bf and I have known each other for   years when we became a couple one and a half years ago and about half a year ago I moved in with him due to the bad relationship I have with my mom   He is just perfect  The most loving and caring guy I have ever met  I love him to pieces and I know we are young but I feel like I could spend the rest of my life with him  We share the same interests and have the same plans for the future  I couldn t wish for anything more and for me he is the most attractive man in the world   Our sex life has always been absolutely amazing  but a few months ago I recognized it was always me who initiates sex and sometimes he even rejected me  I have a very very high sex drive and felt like it was my fault like maybe he didn t find me attractive anymore and that really hurt me because I have a very unstable self confidence and it kinda depends on sex  I know that s weird and I m working on that     So last weekend I told him about all of that and cried a lot because I really feared he doesn t want me anymore  He told me it s not my fault and that I should not worry about that  Yesterday we went out for dinner and he suddenly said that it s about his self confidence  that he doesn t find himself attractive anymore which I can t understand at all   I really want to help him but i have no idea how    Do you guys have any advice what I could do  
422,0,Friend AI think I love my boyfriend but   I m starting to have doubts  I actually liked his best friend since Jr  high  Mind you I m gonna be a senior next year  So yeah  I m dumb and young  I got out of a year relationship two thee months before getting with my current boyfriend  Let s call his best friend  Friend A   I ve liked friend A for so long and it s not changing even though friend A has shut me down  But I can t get over him  How perfect he is and how much he makes me a better person    It s crazy to say if I could I would be with friend A in a heart beat  Because of how much he means to me  It s sounds like a clich   But he practically saved my life  He s been the best friend I ve had for so long and I d never give him up for anything  He s the sweetest guy I ve ever met  So unsure of himself but you d never be able to tell that  All he wants to do is help people even if that means sacrificing himself  He calls it selfish that helping people is the thing he likes best about himself   Friend A is my dream spouse  I don t think I ve even got a remote chance with him though    I m dating his best friend and he is nice and all  I got trapped in this relationship after rebounding and I feel guilty for it  But I do like him  I just don t think he s what I really want  He s amazing smart and a good guy really  I wouldn t want the break up to end our friendship  But it probably would  So I ve sunk my self deeper and deeper into this relationship as it drowns me I tell myself it s what I want  But is it really  He s a pretty sexually focused guy we didn t do anything but he talks about kinks and stuff more then most guys  He s a sub and this is his first relationship so   I don t have any idea what I m doing anyway     Should I drop everything for friend A     He s here with me now trying to solve my relationship problems   making me laugh at work  I love this man  Why does everything have to be so complicated  Just his cologne is enough to make me smile it s crazy  How I can remember every face he makes how he d react  What he d do   is it wrong  It is wrong to like him while being in a relationship   Also I d like to make it clear my boyfriend isn t pushing for anything  He just talks about it more then I feel he should  He s won t even kiss me without my agreement XD   Friend A A good friend who is merely in love  but decides to help you with your love anyways  They re usually sweet and kind  but discreet  They re just forging a friend relationship with you to keep tabs in a non stalker way

425,0,Did my boyfriend cheat in our bed This is going to be a long story so I already want to thank everyone who takes the time to read it   My boyfriend and I  both in our mid   s are together for four years  There has been an issue with a female co worker of his for over two years  He hang out at her house in secret     yrs ago  I found out much later  He claims nothing happens  They still work together and text sometimes  but less frequent  He swears he won t hang out with her   she has send inappropriate texts and such   We live together in our own house  I leave every monday morning to another city and come back thursday morning for work issues  This means he is alone for    hours   This thursday morning   am I got out of the bus and saw that girl walking to the bus  We live in a small craphole place  with nothing to do  We have a supermarket  a bakery  one tiny clothing store and that is it  This girl lives in another city  works in another city and studies in another city  I know she has NO friends or family in our town  because she mentioned it earlier to my boyfriend    You are the only one I know that wants to live in that crap place     What was her reason to be there  so early in the morning  I came home and my boyfriend was in bed asleep  with the window and curtains open  He always sleeps with the window and curtains closed  Also his jacket lay on the floor near the door  We live together for   months and his jacket never laid on the floor before   I confronted and he said she was not there and has never been to our house  Then I decided to check his internet history  Yes  fellow redditors  I know this is wrong but I do NOT want a rant about this   I know how much Redditors want to burn alive people who do this  I checked it  It was a mistake  I know  Please no rant about how bad it is or how my relationship is doomed already   So I saw that the evening before he watched some netflix on his tablet until   PM  After that  things get weird  He watched youtube on his mobile from       to       PM  This is odd  because I am with this guy for   years and he NEVER watches youtube on his phone when he is inside the house  He always only does this when he is in the bus  outside or whatever  However no busses drove at that moment so that can t be true  After       there was no signs of activity anymore on his phone  tablet or computer   He set up an alarm clock at       PM    The first next activity was next day       am when he put off his alarm clock  and then       on Whatsapp   He has a car that he shares with his mom  Wednesday we got into the car and he said  Mom keeps asking bout the car and drives my fuel till its empty  And I said  no she didn t asked for the car for at least   weeks why you bring this up  He just said oh it bothers me   He kept bringing up this girl a couple of times   I don t think it was her  I think you saw it wrong  Probably can t be her  blah blah    So  fellow Redditors  What do you think of his behavior and signals   TL DR Boyfriend might be cheating and I don t know what to do 
426,0,Boyfriend   m  and I    f  disagree about abortionHi   I ve    f  been with my boyfriend    m  for almost   months and it s been so wonderful  He s sweet and hilarious and I enjoy being with him  A couple days ago  I went to the doctor to get my birth control implant replaced  I m a dummy and forgot unprotected sex before receiving a new birth control implant should be avoided  there s a risk for pregnancy due to the new implant not taking effect until   days later  I was talking to my boyfriend earlier about what we would do if I ended up pregnant  I told him I would opt for abortion  but he is persistent on me having the baby  This turned into an argument where I told him it s ultimately my body and he can t force me to have a baby I don t want  My arguments were that we re both still in school  don t have great jobs  and I just don t want a baby right now  He s pretty upset  but begrudgingly agreed to whatever decision I wanted  I know this isn t what he wants  so I m worried our stances will drive us apart if I do end up pregnant  How do I approach him again with this  Should I tell him if he wants to break up with me because I opted for abortion  it s okay  Or  I m pretty overwhelmed and worried I might be pregnant  so any advice regarding anything I said will be really appreciated   tl dr  Boyfriend and I have differing views on abortion and I m worried it might cause issues if I do end up pregnant  EDIT  my boyfriend s reasonings for keeping the baby is that he doesn t want to miss out on having a child  I do understand that  but I feel he isn t taking into account all the factors against us

436,0,Love and CultureMy fianc     M  and I    F  have been in a relationship for almost   years  He is Indian and I am not  We ve had our share of differences  but we love each other  We decided to get engaged   years ago knowing that his family did not approve  We struggled with that and overcame huge hurdles to become homeowners and start our life   Marriage planning was put on hold after all his family did not attend our engagement    During the last year  his younger brother was arranged in marriage  It was a constant parade for the brother  His new wife was out of state and my fianc  was  expected  to attend all events  I was not included  It created a lot of strain in our relationship because I caught him in a lot of lies  He wouldn t tell me about the plans that were made  His parents booked all the trips and never ask him if he could go  wanted to go or for how long  It really affected my self esteem and made me doubt my fianc   I tried to be supportive knowing he couldn t say no to his parents  I was forced to compromise and give in   He has never had a close relationship with his parents or brother  He tells me that s how the  culture  is  No one speaks of their feelings   I felt abandoned and betrayed that he would pick up and go at any moment his parents asked  I tried to express my feelings the best I could to my fianc  and his mother  but he didn t  know what to do and she didn t understand  It was worse to see my fianc  come back from these trips like nothing happened    I have not met his father  who refused to meet me and forbade me from going to their house or business  This is also part of the culture that my fianc  wanted me to understand   anything the father says goes    This last year has been the most stressful and draining for both us  I ve had mental breakdowns a number of times and ended up on medication   At a loss of options  I even gave him the option to end things before the brother s    day wedding to avoid the pain it would cause us  He assured me we could get through it  I know I added stress by trying to get to a solution and pressuring him to stand up to his parents    Seeing that he was still conflicted after the brother s wedding  I asked him this week to get help from his mother   She had declined any invitation to come see me and ignored my messages in the last   months  during brother s engagement wedding   so her advice was hurtful  yet expected  She advised my fianc  to come back home  parent s home  if we were both unhappy  She said she couldn t do anything about his father and did not accept responsibility for how they treated me  She said that s how the culture is and she couldn t change it  She also said she s been stressed worrying about my fianc  and it has been affecting her health     My fianc  left our home and has been staying at a hotel  He said he was leaving me because he didn t want to hurt me anymore   He still cares for me and comforts me  The fact that he didn t go back to his parents also gives me hope      Other info  my fianc  is the eldest son and works at the family business  His father suffered a stroke over    years and was left disabled  His mother was supportive in the beginning  I have respected his parents and their decisions  My family loves and supports us  I am lost  but I know life finds a way     Should I wait for my fianc  to figure out things or accept that it s over        I appreciate any advice   Love always   B
437,0,Do you consider   I have been with my boyfriend for   years now  we have our ups and down as all relationships but on average have a great partnership  I ve known him since the  th grade  and he is one of my best friends  Until yesterday when I saw his message screen on Reddit  and noticed he has been messaging other women  sex workers    and unfortunately said some sexual things  I am a woman and support sex workers so I know that whoever he is messaging and looking at is his choice I would never be upset about the posts he looks at  I m don t get upset at the idea of my man watching porn  etc  but something about him messaging commenting on their posts has made me upset  He tells me that it s not a big deal  since he could never  be with them  or  meet them  which yes may be true  but it still hurt me to know that he wanted a reaction from them or wanted to talk to them  versus only watching on the screen  He is also claiming that he believes he has a masturbation problem and has a porn addiction  For now I told him I needed time to think and that I couldn t be with him until I knew if I could forgive him    Which brings me to my main question  is it okay for me to be upset  Would you be okay with your man watching porn  but not okay to communicate with the ladies in the film    Also if you have had this happen in your own relationship  what was your reaction  Did you stay together or leave

443,0,I m afraid my anxiety will make my boyfriend want to leaveAlright so  I m a    year old girl and I have the most amazing boyfriend  He is very kind  patient  and understanding  He hasn t gotten upset at me even once  I have pretty bad anxiety and I always feel like I dont deserve him or that he could do better  I overreact to small things and get jealous easily  Whenever he talks to some girl I ll ask him if he thought she was hot and all  Point is  I know I m unhealthy  I know my behavior is toxic towards him at times  and I absolutely hate it  But I have no idea how to change it  There are times where it s better and I dont get overly emotional and I m calm and dont overreact and then there are times where I m just a complete mess and I push him away because of that  Because of my anxious tendencies  he blames himself  I tell him it s not his fault and my behavior isnt about him but rather is something I have to work through but nonetheless  its hard for him to stop being upset  I feel like such a toxic and horrible girlfriend and I dont want to be that way  I want to have a peaceful loving relationship and I consistently get in the way of that and I just dont know what to do   any advice 
444,0,My    M  married friend says he cares about me   I have a friend who I ve known for   years  We worked closely and now we work together but not in the same office like before  We talk almost every day  He has no friends in the office but is cordial with everyone   He tells me everything except about his family  I am open about everything as well but that s who I am    I m starting to question his feelings because I don t have many male friends so I m unsure of how to move forward  I told him he didn t need to email me like we usually do  trying to limit our conversations   He said he wants to keep in contact because he cares about me  likes spending time with me and doesn t want to lose me    I feel like this is inappropriate but he claims his feelings are platonic    Would you consider his feelings platonic or is this not something you say to a friend of the opposite gender  
445,0,I    F  have dated my SO    M  for almost   years and I m having doubts even though the relationship seems great for the most part  Should I try to work it out or is it time to move on Let me start by saying I m pretty horrible with my emotions  I m not good at expressing them  talking about them  or understanding them  I spend a ton of time thinking about why I m feeling the way I am  but I never really seem to get anywhere  That s kind of the main reason I m coming here to write everything out and get third party perspective on my situation  so if I seem to be contradictory or disjointed when talking about all this then that s why  And feel free to call me out on it   My issues right now are that I am afraid to be committed to the serious relationship I m in  I ve been in back to back longterm relationships since I was a teenager and the longest I ve been single since then is a span of about     months when I was    years old  I feel like I never really got to figure myself out as an independent person  I never really dated around or did anything on my own  I don t really have many close friends because I either drifted from them b c of being in a relationship or they were friends with an ex and we stopped talking after the breakup  Basically  I m kinda scared I m being held back somehow and I can t help but wonder if there could be something someone better for me in the future       Anyway  like the title says I ve been with my boyfriend for almost   years  We met online and moved in together after meeting for the first time  which I know is crazy and was a huge gamble and could have gone very  very poorly  but somehow it worked out really well for us  We are so compatible and comfortable with each other  we spend all of our free time together and never get sick of each other  Neither of us has ever asked for  alone time   we ve always been content to be  alone  together  He makes me laugh so much  we always have fun together and we love talking to each other about what we re interested in  which is mostly all the same things  He s the best friend I ve ever had in my life  I know I can tell him anything and he ll listen and be understanding and vice versa  we both have issues and we are very understanding and supportive of each other  Most importantly  I love him  I deeply care about him to the point that when he s hurting  I m hurting and I want to do anything to make him feel better  And I think I ve become a much better person while I ve been with him  I think we ve helped each other grow a lot as people     amp  x   B   Now  with all that said  we do have some problems  For one  our sex life  We rarely ever have sex  and I think it s mostly my fault  He would try to initiate and I would make an excuse or ignore it basically  and now he rarely tries  I don t want to hurt his feelings  but for some reason when he starts to act sexually towards me my first instinct is to feel a bit uncomfortable and push him away  laugh it off  I don t know if it s a lack of libido on my part or a lack of attraction  though I don t find him unattractive   but it wasn t this bad in past relationships I ve been in  though it was a problem in them too   We re really affectionate in a non sexual way though  like we cuddle  hold hands  hug and kiss lightly all the time  we do all the cutesy relationship stuff and I m never uncomfortable with it  except I generally don t like PDA   There just seems to be an overall lack of passionate romance  I guess  which I don t even know if that s a justifiable complaint because people say that goes away over time anyway  Am I being unrealistic for wanting to feel butterflies at this stage of the relationship  I get excited to see him when we ve been apart and sometimes I get like a warm  excited feeling when I m around him but it feels more like a kind of deep affection rather than a romantic kind of excitement  I m not sure      Also  we rarely communicate seriously about our relationship  I think we re both way too good at avoiding conflict with each other  so we let everything go even when we get mad at each other about something  We never bring up the lack of sex  and I never voiced the doubts I ve been having  and if he s had any doubts I never heard about them  We talked seriously about our relationship for pretty much the first time a couple days ago and he said he is of course bothered by the lack of sex  but he didn t want to push me because of my issues with it  self esteem  libido  etc    When I told him I was regretting getting into a longterm relationship with him when I did and that I want to experience being independent and  find myself  and all that  he was very understanding but was also really broken up about it  He said he would never want me to be unhappy and if we had to break up for me to be happy then he has no choice  but he definitely doesn t want to break up because he knows absolutely that I m  the one  for him and he has zero doubts about it  Hearing him say that really touched me and convinced me of how much he loves me  I pretty much broke down crying at that moment  Honestly  the thought of breaking his heart feels like stabbing myself in the chest  it s almost unbearable  But at the same time  I m afraid if we stay together and work things out that I ll eventually regret it and start resenting him because of all the  what ifs  in my life      tl dr  I m afraid of committing to my boyfriend even though our relationship is mostly amazing besides our lack of sex and serious communication     amp  x   B   Has anyone else gone through something similar to this  How did you deal with it   Should I stay in the relationship and try to work things out  If so  what s the best way to do it  
446,0,I ve    F  been talking to dating a guy    M  for    months but now I feel something is off  I dont know what to do  Do I message him Hi everyone  I ll jump right into it  I matched with this guy on tinder back about     months ago  we had some nice conversations but with hectic schedules it just dropped off  during this time we followed each other on instagram and snapchat  Also during this time I found out our past relationship situations had been similar  both had long term    year relationships and both had ended it   About a month after the conversations dropped off I had posted a picture on instagram  he then messaged me because he recognised one of the other people in it and asked how I knew him  Long story short he apologised for dropping off in messaging and the messaging started up again   From this point we messaged and sent snaps very often at least daily  a lot of flirting  jokes  general conversation and pet names for me like  bella  beautiful  it was really nice  Fast forward to around NYE  about a month of talking at this point  we didn t have any plans to meet up but knew what each other was doing  I remember expectin hoping for a message at    but I ended up just sending a message at   am anyway because I didn t think to wait  I got a message back and we kept talking into the night  he was at a party with his friends and they we re going pretty hard  We we re both pretty drunk at this point and we re just talking non sense and having fun  He mentioned that we should meet and I said  has to be before I leave  as I was going overseas  He was shocked and didn t know I was going and said again we have to meet up  The conversation continued from this  all casual and funny  he then said that out of the blue that he wasn t good enough for me and he is crazy and that I was apparently  too nice  or I m guessing  innocent  for him according to his friends who he showed pictures of me too  As I said we we re both drunk so I just told him to stop talking shit and it was all light hearted  I began to sober up and was getting a bit annoyed by the conversation which was involving things said previously  so bluntly just said  whatever  I m into you here s my number do what you want with it  and left it at that   Skip to the next afternoon  I get a text from someone saying from what I remember   Hi Bella  how are you feeling today   or something along those lines  I was surprised at first but messaged back general conversation about new years and eventually he asked me out on a date  He said he hadn t been on a date in over   years and apologised that he didn t really know what to do it was sweet  As you can guess I was overjoyed and excited  we joked because I wasn t free that week and he teased me for stalling and we eventually planned to meet up the next week  From this point we kept messaging and snapping and it was really nice   Skip to the next week we we re chatting as normal but I felt like something was off  we weren t texting as much and I was stressing out a bit  I started more conversations than I had been but it seemed like he wasn t as into it  not NOT into it but not as much as previously  I got a bit upset and left him for a day or so when he messaged me about our meeting up that afternoon  he wanted to know if I was still down for it and I said if you are I am  he said he definitely was  He also apologised because sometimes he gets in mood where he just cant be bothered and cant find energy to do things hence the lack of texts  So later that night we finally meet  nerves and all  and we had the most amazing night  We had dinner  chatted for hours  laughed  he was touchy  teasing and kept complementing me and we ended up spending roughly six hours together  Till around   am even though he had work at   the next day I was so happy  He also apologised for what he said on NYE and said that s not him  his being  crazy  became a inside joke  After he dropped me home he said to message him when I got back so we could hang out again   After he dropped me home and he got home one of us  cant remember who exactly  said thanks for such a great night  I think it was him  and we kept chatting as usual    days later I flew overseas   Now  throughout my entire holiday      weeks  he messaged me almost EVERY DAY I was really surprised but so happy  I cant explain how much I loved this  even when some of our conversations we re simple  I got a good morning beautiful or good morning princess so many mornings and I reciprocated this of course  generally just lots of loving  We just couldn t wait to see each other  I realised on this trip how much I enjoyed and expected a message or anything from him that when I didn t get one I was so upset and down  I ll also add he was SO COMPLIMENTARY and replied with messages to anything I posted of myself saying I was beautiful or cute or sexy etc   When I got back we we re possibly going to meet up that night to hang out  friday  but I already had plans with some friends  Turns out some of his friends we re planning on going out to the same place  area that night and even though we may not see each other there was always the possibility  Anyway  that night we are out  not drinking  my friends and I when I message him asking if he is out  he said not yet but his friends we re frustrating him for various and I think valid reasons  I joked he should come see me and he said he actually would  So my friends left and we decided to meet up  we met up and got some food and chatted  he was being all sweet and just like normal  We continue the rest of the night just walking around having fun  talking  etc  We ended up kissing and things started to get a little hea  he asked me to come back with him but I said I couldn t because of something on the next day  he was perfectly fine with that and got me a ride home  we said we d meet up soon  On the way home I texted him saying I really wanted to go with him but couldn t and he returned the message with a similar statement and we said goodnight   The next day we we re both busy doing whatever and I got a text asking if I wanted to hangout tomorrow  I said yes and usual follows  Next day comes and we go out for lunch and just lay in the sun together  talking  cuddling  kissing  etc  We spend the rest of the day at mini golf  more eating  having fun  He had a game on later that night and asked me if I wanted to come watch I said yes  As the day went on he realised he got his team colour wrong and I offered a shirt in the colour he needed so we went back to my house and I got the shirt  We hung at my house for a few hours and eventually slept together  it was great and a long time coming  After it was really nice we just laid together and it was sweet and fun lots of laughing  I remember feeling so happy because he just seemed so happy to be with me and wouldn t stop complementing me  To cut it short we went to the game  I met some friends  he drove me home and kissed me goodbye  From here on its usual chat   Through out the next two weeks we kept talking all the time as usual and we planned to meet up again  at first it was on a Friday but I forgot I had something on  he was cool with it and we changed it so Saturday  for reference he works a lot and changing hours   Saturday comes and he s working late till around        but still is really keen on meeting up and says he misses me which made me happy  So he comes all the way to pick me up  he lives across town  and we got get dinner at this sweet little place on his end of town  It was beautiful and lovely  I remember being nervous and I don t know why like I didn t want this to be ruined  We went back to his house and we walked his dog  we both love dogs so it was a running topic in our conversations  That was lovely and fun and then we went back to his house and watched a movie eventually we slept together again  I set an alarm on my phone just in case we fell asleep and I remember saying do you want me to set one just in case we fall asleep  and he said something along the lines of oh yeah I ll just drop you back before work  We both had work  the next morning  I said don t worry I ll get an uber and he wouldn t have it insisting he drops me home  So I stayed over and the next day he dropped me home  the conversation on the way back was light because we we re both so tried but I remember just feeling that something may be off  Anyway he drops me home  but we didn t kiss I didn t try to initiate but I thought that was a bit off   Anyway  the day goes on and I send a snap without a response but don t think anything of it  Going off the top of my head I remember messaging asking how work went and he said it was cruisy and we had a general chat  I think I said good luck with your game and maybe the conversation continued  honestly I cant remember that part  Anyway  the next week we chatted and snapped but too me it felt like less  but he wasn t ignoring me he was starting conversations  he replied to my stories and he asked if I wanted to go see a show and of course I said yes  Anyway this continues like this  from this point I remember just feeling a bit uneasy like something was off and being a bit sad even though we we re talking still  I put it down to overthinking  I ask him later on in this week what the date was of the show he said was again and it reminded him to book it  so we booked it and that was that  I didn t see him that weekend but as usual chatted  I went out with friends and hurt myself and put it as you do on social media  I didn t hear any sort of comment from him on it and was a bit suss about that  During this weekend we didn t talk as much  I asked him a few days earlier if he was free at all on the weekend because it was a long weekend and he said he wasn t sure because he was working most of it  He didn t say it coldly or anything but I remember feeling a bit anxious at that  So I decided to not ask him again to hang on the weekend but leave it up to him  he didn t message me to hang out but I knew he had to the whole monday off because its a public holiday  We didn t talk that day until I posted a picture of my ankle and he asked me if I was okay  I told him what happened and he was empathetic and sweet about it  I asked him how his weekend was and he said average because he worked most of it and I said to him surely you enjoyed Monday being a day off but he didn t really reply to that  One thing I should mention is that he had started to leave me on read seen more but not to questions more when a conversation is ending but regardless it was something I picked up on it   He messaged me the next day all excited about a game he had watched and it was a sweet and fun convo  I ended up crashing my car that day and he was very empathetic about it all  We didn t message the rest of the day but he sent me a message the next day asking how I am  how my ankle is and if I would be able to walk on Friday for our show or would I need to be carried  I was in a bit of a bad mood overthinking everything and replied to all but said to his comment about the show  why are you trying to find a way out of it lol  he replied with of course not silly and the conversation continued on   Eventually it ended and there were a few more snaps messages in the week but they didn t feel the same as other times  Friday came and he suggested we get there earlier to eat or have a drink  so he picked me up  even though I offered to drive  and we went  I think I went into this overthinking and kept thinking about how he hadn t put his hand on my leg while driving  he usually does  and convinced myself something was off  but we had a good conversation and it was like normal  Now at the place we got food  I wasn t starving but was going to eat if he was so we order and go to pay  One point I have to make clear here is that he always insisted on paying when we went out other times he paid by his own decision even though I offered and he said he loved treating me   This time it came to paying and she asked if we were going to split it and he said yeah can we pay separately  My heart dropped a little but I tried not to overthink it  after this we had general fun chit chat and gambled just for the sake of it it was fun  When we went into the show things started to pick up be bought us both a drink and told me some of  his future plans and we joked around  After the show I asked what the plan was and he suggested dessert etc  There we re places around us that had ice cream but we drove to a beach about       minutes away that we had been to before  The drive there was my highlight his hand was on my leg he was being touchy and we we re having such a great time he was all excited about getting this desert we constantly talked about  I then said I was house sitting some dogs around the area and he asked if he could come see them when I was doing that and I said of course  When we got to the beach he offered me his jacket and we went and ate  he was being touchy and sweet and cheeky it was lovely  I paid for the food even though he pulled out his card because I wanted to avoid what happened earlier  After that we walked back to this car and I said how cold it was so he wrapped his arms around me and was being goofy it felt like it normally does  After I said whats the plan and he said not sure  I said it was his decision because he had work tomorrow so he said he would drop me home  I remember being a bit sad because  a  I wanted to spend more time with him and b  it was only around       where as other times we had stayed out till     am without any issue   Anyway  the drive home I asked him if he had anything coming up he said not much a friends   st and a concert in a few weeks  He started to vent about work and how its hard because he doesn t get weekends off which I understand  When we got back to mine I remember feeling a bit sad and anxious  I asked him if I would see him at all over over the next few weeks because I know he s busy but I want to see him more often because I like spending time with him  He replied with  Aww  I have some week nights free we can do something   I wanted to say more because over the past   weeks I had just been upset and worried because I felt something was off but I didn t and I wish I did  Anyway  I replied with okay and left  he didn t kiss me   The next morning I got a message from him saying thanks for making me smell good with a picture of him wearing the jacket  I replied but he didn t reply to that   After this we didn t really talk a lot  I sent a snap and he didn t reply and I got very upset  I decided to leave it and wait a few days and then about   days later I sent a message saying    Hello  are you free anytime this week to do something  he replied about an hour or so later saying   hey    I honestly don t know what my work schedule is like for this week and its my birthday and idk what I want to do for it I m stressing haha   I followed with  thats ok  hope u have a great birthday and do something fun    u can message me if you want to hang x  from this he said he ll probably do nothing and he s tired of working on weekends he then apologised for his lack of chats to me  I followed with saying to do something with friends and working weekends sucks  in short   I also said I was going ask to if he was alright because he seemed a bit off lately and our chats seemed different but didn t want to press him  He said he was fine with a big smiley face and said a personal joke of ours about split personalities  I said I m glad he s good and had a laugh about the joke     NOW    I followed this message with this   Just putting it out there though  as much as I enjoy hanging out with you dont feel like you cant be honest with me if you dont   He then left me on read for   days     days later he replies with  Hey  sorry I never replied to this I didn t really understand it haha  I m always honest I promise xx I just go through these CBF times always I m sorry  I replied a few hours later with   I replied with   Okay  things have just seemed off compared to usual and I couldn t gauge if it was because you aren t into it or if something else was wrong  just thought I would check xx  He left me on read for almost   days again   I was pretty upset at this point and have been stuck in a low point for a while because of it   About a day and a half later it was his birthday and I was hesitant to say Happy Birthday  I had been pretty upset  crying etc because I didn t understand what was happening  I posted a snap chat story of a dog I was house sitting and he replied to it just like he used too and we had a funny convo about the dog   I ended up sending a simple birthday message saying  Happy Birthday  Hope you figured out something fun x  He replied quickly saying  Thankyou heaps    I didn t really figure anything I just CBF with it lol I have work tomorrow so I m going to bed early xx  I said  Fair enough  and hope you at least had cake x  and left it there  He then followed on saying  Also  I just want to let you know that I m completely aware that I ve been acting weird lol it s just a whole bunch of shit on my mind but I wont really open up to you about it because I like keeping things to myself  just so you know nothing is you fault ever xx   He also talked about how he has been battling this cough which we both had for weeks and its putting him in bad moods because he just wants to be healthy again   I then said it s okay and thanks for telling me  I m always here to talk if he needs to no pressure  then went on to talk about the cough  He replied  then I replied  then end of conversation  We haven t talked since then and its been exactly a week  I sent a snap and he didn t reply and then he sent me a snap of a dog which I didn t see till almost   hour after sent so didn t reply to it  We haven t talked since then   It s now been a week and I ve been a bit distraught  upset and not sleeping well  I want to talk to him so bad but am conflicted  He said he knew he was acting weird and was sorry about it and it makes me want to check on him  On the other hand he could message me easily but hasn t  He has his friends   st tomorrow and I keep thinking the worst  what if he hooks up with someone else etc  I ve been over analysing this and I just feel like if he was trying to ghost me he wouldn t have said what he said or apologised or asked to come see the dogs when I house sit etc  But another part of me thinks the opposite     I don t know what to do  do I message him  Give him a week and a bit space or do I leave it  I really like him     Sorry for the long post everyone I didn t know what to include or leave it out  xx   amp  x   B 
447,0,I m getting worriedMy girlfriend didn t text me in   weeks and I don t know how to talk to her in school 
448,0,I    F  think I have feelings for a close internet friend    M  who lives      miles away from me To start from the very beginning  I met this boy  who  for the sake of privacy  I ll refer to as    T  online  Really  I was added to a groupchat by a close family friend who wanted me to socialize more  He happened to be in that groupchat  though I didn t have much interest in him at first  after all  there were a dozen other people I was just getting to know  Of course  it wasn t before long that I finally settled in as an official member of this newfound friend group and was able to form opinions feelings for every individual  I soon noticed my increased interest in T  However  those tiny romantic feelings faded within a few weeks     amp  x   B   T and I carried on as friends  I consider him exceptionally close to me  especially so when compared to even the family friend who invited me into the groupchat  He sees me as a little sister  although I m only a few months younger than he is  He s very close to me  and I cherish him loads more than I can put into words  if that makes sense   I trusted him with some incredibly personal information about my life  and he often came to me when in need  I can say that we re close friends    amp  x   B   Today  it s been a little over half a year since I joined the group chat  and  consequently  since I met T   Was it     weeks ago  though  that my crush resurfaced  We were in a video call  along with a few others in the groupchat  when I felt flustered as I spoke to him  I couldn t help but feel nervous  though that has never happened previously in my conversations with him  I blush whenever I think of him these days  and I want nothing more than to confess how I feel to him    but      amp  x   B   He s still hung up on his ex  I ve never seen someone so torn up about an ex    At the same time  he lives hundreds of miles away from me  though he MAY soon move near me for university   Not to mention the fact that he sees me as a little sister  damn my baby face and childish voice     amp  x   B   I don t think I have even the slimmest of chances  but I still can t help but feel like I MUST confess to him  or shoot my shot  really   What should I do  Should I risk the good  platonic  relationship we have now  Should I wait until he gets over his ex before I confess  Should I ever confess 
449,0,I think my girlfriend is too immatureMy girlfriend      and I      have been together for over a year now  First let me say I am by no means perfect  I am for one have a hard time making my own decisions and typically wait for confirmation from other before I act   Kind of like I m doing here now that I think about it    I get we are both very young  I am very mature for my age and get told that by many people  Most of my friends I ve met through work and are between    and     She is currently in college and living at home with her parents  She does have a job and works as a waiter at a restaurant part time   I dropped put of college and ended up getting my CCNA and other networking certifications and got a job as a network services engineer   I hated school and they way they forced me to learn and didn t allow me to go teach myself material on my own in a quiet place   Last year I purchased my first house and am living on my own  I also this year registered my own LLC to setup dev op network infrastructure and workflow    The issues I have with the small things about her in my head just seem like petty annoyances  For example  she is EXTREMELY lovey dovey torwards me all the time  While this is cute it can get old and makes me feel like I m dating a teenager  She always wants to hang on me and lay on me in public  She calls me all the time just to say I miss you  Or just want to tell me she loves me and wants to cuddle   This will happen at least     times a day  its sweet but    yea   She always wants to watch children movies  Like shrek  happy feet  Animated movies  That s fine and its her taste but when we watch a movies like  Flight  Sully  or Game of thrones or something  it literally cannot hold her attention and will ask me      questions of things that go right over her head If I talk to her about any abstract and large pictured topics She gravitates to simple answers without any logical thought   The other day I told her this  Look its cute you call me to tell me how much you love me and want me to tell you how much more I love you  And how much I miss you but I m busy and doing things in my daily life  Its not that I don t love you but honestly I m not thinking about you       I have thing like work  my business  hobbies and friends I m with and occupied with it all during the day  When I m home at  pm  making dinner alone watching tv  that s when I think of you and realize I miss you  At which point Ill call you and my attention is on you    Of course she over thought completely and couldn t wrap her head around this  She took it as  I care about other things more than I care about her   She ask me in a emotional tantrum  So you wouldnt even miss me if I didn t talk you for a day   My response was  Of course I miss you during the day  I have never said I don t miss you   She the uses this to say I lied to her in my first statement   At this point in the argument I said   Babe  I love you but if we can t both have a rational discussion about this right now  then I m not having it  We both should relax  calm down and discuss this later when we can look at the bigger picture and consider each others point of view and opinions without bias or emotions   She the proceeded to get mad at me how I never fight back and always ignore her when she s right   This is usually not that common because I avoid telling her things that I already know she will overthink and meltdown over   Anyway  what should I do to better communicate with her  I want her and I to share all the fun and happiness we have together outside of the issues described  Were both adults and sometimes I feel like I m back in high school dating someone with the unnessisary amount of drama    What are some tips to better address and resolve the issues I have with her    I m sure she has plenty of issues with me and I would love to hear them  I love to be honestly critisized because it allows me to identify my shortcomings and work at becoming a better person  That s my personality whereas my gf takes them as direct attacks

456,0,He s always masturbating in the shower in secret So me      and my boyfriend      have been together for   years now   Things moved pretty quickly and I became pregnant as we moved in together  We kept our son who is now    weeks old  but our sex life has dropped off the edge of a cliff  Which I expected  but one thing I didn t was my sex drive remaining just as high and his almost disappearing completely  I initiate every single time we have sex  Now each morning he takes his phone into the bathroom for an hour long masturbation session     I understand the sleep deprivation and that our son comes as a priority now  but what I can t understand is that he s masturbating twice a day in the shower which are hour long showers while our son is asleep  During these showers we would have plenty of time to have sex together but he doesn t seem to be interested unless I come on extremely strong   He tells me I m beautiful daily  and that he loves me  I m getting back into shape and I haven t gained an excessive amount of weight whilst pregnant  He tells me I get a lot of attention from other men  but I genuinely don t notice as I only see him  He will kiss and cuddle me still but it s starting to bother me that he would rather masturbate than have sex with me  I m getting extremely frustrated and it s really affecting my relationship with him   I ve spoken to him about this but it hasn t changed anything  If anything he just tries to be more secretive about doing it  I don t have an issue with him masturbating  we all do it   just that he s being secretive about it  when he never used to be   and that he doesn t seem to want to have sex with me   Guys can you please explain why he s acting like this  Is there anything I can say or do to change this behaviour

461,0,My  F  s  FWB  M  s  thinks I sabotaged his possible relationship with side chick  Long story sorry  Short version at bottom of post    My  F  s  and my FWB  M  s  have known each other since we were kids   We have had a FWBs situation for well over a year now  I have a key to his place  Fairly recently  he met this chick who he wants a relationship with but she has been acting kind of weird around him  doesn t want to have sex with him  barely talks to him or sees him  ghosts him for days to weeks at a time  randomly will want to come over late at night for what seems like a booty call but nothing ever happens   In almost four months now of meeting her she has maybe seen him three times for like an hour at the most   Literally two days after meeting her he asked her to move in with him because her living situation sucks but she declined     The other night  she went over to his place in the middle of the night  The next morning  I picked him up for work and we talked about it  I asked him what time she left  he said she didn t and is still there sleeping and will let herself out when she wakes up    He got home the next day and he noticed that a pile of ones that he keeps on his dresser  he saves his ones for when we go out to strip clubs together  was gone   She didn t call him to say she left  nothing  He messaged her to ask what time she left and she told him at like  am   He was pretty pissed because it is pretty obvious she took it  It was a small amount  under         He told me he was done with her because of what happened     This morning  I drove him to work   She called him on the way and he picked up and talked to her like nothing ever happened   He doesn t want to straight out ask her if she took it    He said to me that he had a thought that came into his head for a minute that maybe I went to his house and took the money to sabotage his relationship with her   I was like WTF   First of all  I have known him like forever   I have a key to his place  If I wanted to steal from him  I would have done it by now and I definitely wouldn t steal that small amount of money as I make well into six figures so I definitely don t need his ones   Not to mention the fact that whenever we go out  I play his wing man   I know what he likes and I get their numbers for him   Thing is  this chick lives in a trailer in someone s yard with no heat or running water   Not saying that that in itself would make her a thief  but you just never know   I told him I was kinda pissed that he even had a thought like that  We are best friends and spend every single day together  I told him he probably shouldn t leave a chick in his house when he leaves when he barely knows her  Anyway  now he is backtracking and saying it was a quick thought and he dismissed it quickly and shouldn t have even considered that for a second     Point is  am I in the wrong to be as hurt as I am over this   Short version  FWB s side chick that he barely knows stole from him and he thinks I may have actually stolen the money to sabotage any possible relationship he could have with her  Should I be hurt over him even thinking that

465,0,My     f  ex girlfriend is gonna be the one that got away if I don t figure out my shit Edit super long   I m     m  life is super complicated and hard  I m in college working full time and my family has always had issues not totally necessary to address  but kind of in a  once I live on my own maybe life will be normal  scenario  But my perfect piece of normalcy came in the form of the sweetest most amazing girl I ve ever met  I m an ex edgy punk kid who smokes too much weed and wishes I could believe in god but just can t convince myself of it  she s a Christian guitarist who before our first date had never even held hands with a guy  I don t know how it happened but we were just happy with each other  any second together or talking to each other we were just content and mature and everyone around us was convinced we were meant to be  Super innocent  super adorable  And no one like her has ever been in my life  she was obsessed with me and I was crazy about her    months of some of the happiest dating I think possible  no fights  all love and gifts and adventures  her parents grew to love me as I worked with her dad and I am a very consistent hard worker  I came to their church sundays and youth group on Friday s  visited her house all the time  ate with them  Pretty much was family  My entire life was structured around her and she kept me on track so even in my worst most stressed times I had her to fall back on    Then it all went bad in a single night  She made the simplest mistake of texting her mom instead of me one night about how much she wished I could sneak down into her room   I was currently sleeping on her couch  planned on going to work snowplowing with her dad at   am  her mom took this very badly  they ended up searching through her phone and finding everything we d ever said  including fairly graphic texts and pictures  again we were in love for months  it happens  She sometimes felt guilty but overall I respected her so much and took things so slow I barely worried about them finding out about our not so sex life  we never even considered sex and I never even had my pants off we pretty much just made out really aggressively and I d tease her and stuff but this was still too much for the family and they got pretty upset fast  I had to work a full morning with him after finding out  It was awful  awkward and terrifying  He wasn t even that hard on me I m just so bad with a confrontation like this and had no idea what to do  I barely remember what he said but apparently he had expected me to just continue showing up to church and stuff but since he hadn t spelled this out I had no idea  Afraid of how things would change since I already knew I wouldn t see a moment alone with her again I leave that conversation hoping I ll figure things out  A month and a half later and I have had no contact  I texted her once which they took very harshly and blocked me on everything   I m falling behind in everything  I m a complete mess  My life consisted literally of her  no other friends just coworkers and classmates  She was everything to me my absolute best friend and I lost her so quick and there was nothing I could do  It s been a month and she s making due just because she has no choice the way her family is  i can t even be sure she wants me anymore but I m gonna try and reach out in person tomorrow and apologize to the family as a group  this is too long and I hate myself for posting it already but even the smallest advice or kind words would really be appreciated  This literally means everything

468,0,Is it wrong for me    M  to encourage my wife    F  to drink Hey reddit    So I don t want to give a TON of backstory on this  because it ll end up way too long  I ll just say this  My wife and I have been married    years  dated   years prior to that  Our sex life has always been extremely unsatisfying for me  At present we have sex about     times per year  We we dated it was maybe once a month  and honestly that s why we dated for   years  Had our sex life been somewhat satisfying I would have proposed after   years or so  It s not just frequency  My wife is EXTREMELY uptight about sex  In our    years together  and prior to the the start of this story  we d only had sex in the missionary position  She has never initiated sex  In fact  I didn t realize this until I starting really thinking about it to tell this story  my wife had never seen or touched my penis  with her hands   We always have sex in the dark  under the covers  no oral or anything  My penis has really only touched my wifes vagina and maybe some accidental touching during  foreplay   Foreplay is in quotes because it s just making out and maybe me playing with her breasts a little bit  She won t let me go down on her  she won t go down on me    So onto the main point here  I like to drink  I have a nice little home bar setup  and I have     drinks generally   or   nights a week  I know it s not the most healthy habit but I enjoy it and I don t drive drunk  I don t treat my wife poorly  alcohol just doesn t negatively affect my life really so I think it s fine  My wife doesn t have any problem with it either  However  she s never really had a drink before  she s just never had any desire  Until a few months ago  Not sure why but  as we were hanging out watching Netflix on a Saturday night  she asked if she could taste my drink  I was enjoying a nice bourbon and warned her she probably wouldn t enjoy it  She took a smell of it and almost gagged  She asked if I could make her a drink she would enjoy  I don t really keep anything on hand to make fancy cocktails or pina coladas or anything  but I said sure and mixed her a pretty weak rum and coke  She started drinking it and said it just tasted like coke  asked if I could make another a little stronger  which I did  She started drinking it and not long later  she  for the first time  blurted out   can we have sex    I said abso fucking lutely  We did  had our normal sex and all seemed great    Nothing unusual happened the following week  and when Saturday rolled around and we sat down to watch some Netflix  she asked if I could mix her a rum and coke  I made her a normal strength rum and coke  she enjoyed and asked for a second  I made it and after that  she started putting some moves on me  Never happened before  She was feeling me up  kissing me  it was amazing  We had sex and she was more vocal than she ever had been  To make a long story short  she has been having   drinks every weekend and getting more and more sexually adventurous  We re having sex every week and it s been great  We ve had sex in a few different positions and she s starting to show interest in oral sex  A few weeks ago she didn t ask me for a drink on a Saturday  I made it anyway and she just drank it  Sex happened  That happened a few weeks now  I am starting to feel a little bit scummy about it  I m not forcing her to do anything but we ve had more sex in the last   months than we did in the previous    years combined  She has initiated it every single time  but it s always when she s had something to drink  I have also  always been drinking  but after drinking since I was about     I m sure the two drinks I have have very little effect compared to the   she is having    I m at a loss  am I doing something wrong  I know I should talk to her about it  but after    years of such little sex I really don t want to jinx things  
469,0,Where Do I Draw The Line  BF  amp  Child First time poster here   So    I    f  have been with my boyfriend    m  going on two years now  I ve known him for   years and he was my best friend before we started dating   I have a   year old toddler from my previous relationship  his dad is sketchy and not often around  My bf and I have completely different parenting styles  I have a well behaved toddler  doesnt the throw fits in stores  says please and thank you  etc   compared to most   year olds  For some reason when I m around my son is more rambunctious and energized and slightly clingy  as if he doesnt want to share me  I feel it s because it s where he s most comfortable with me but my bf says my son is manipulating me  He claims my son sees me as a big kid and not a parental figure because I have to repeat myself  Anyone with a child knows that YOU LL REPEAT YOURSELF             TIMES in certain occasions  I try and make discipline a learning experience while he s more cut throat and thinks any little thing deserves a time out and my  yo needs to man up and  stop acting like a baby   I feel sometimes he s being unnecessarily harsh  he grew up with a mean mother and a father who couldn t care less so showing affection for him is hard  He has the mindset that men shouldn t be sensitive  I grew up in a house where if my siblings and I were fighting  we had to hug in the middle of the living room floor till we weren t mad at each other anymore and always said  love ya  before we leave or hang up  My son and bf have an awesome bond and I ve always felt there are things a man can teach a boy that women can t but he seems cold with his discipline  For example earlier today my son fell out of his chair while playing hit his head and instantly started crying I went to pick him up and make sure he was okay  I had only planned to soothe him  wash his face  and give him high five but      the second I picked him up my bf tells him to put him down he ll stop crying on his own and that me picking him up is babying him  My toddler prefers to walk more than be carried so it s not like I have a problem with him wanting to be carried  this seemed like a time to pick want my son up and make sure he was ok  Another example is once we ran out of pullups and I had to run to the store  he was in some little boxers  and I hear my bf telling my son that if he accidentally pees on himself he s putting him in time out as I m hearing to the store  My son only just turned   in January and isn t completely potty trained yet  My son cries when he gets in trouble and is talked to stern my bf feels that him crying because he s in trouble deserves a time out  He s never hit him ever but my son sometimes seem scared like he s going to get into trouble after peeing in his pull up on accident instead of the toilet  I don t want my son to grow up thinking he s less of a man because he shows emotions  We cant discuss it without it becoming an argument because all he sees is me being manipulated into babying my child  He has   kids of his own    amp    and they re well behaved but he treats my toddler as if he s their age and makes me feel chastised for how I treat my son   I get why my bf acts how he does I ve taken enough psych classes to be able to examine and understand his reasoning but I just feel like he forgets that my son s only   and I m not his mom I cant just be mean and just trivialize my son s feelings to make him   harder    Is there a way to meet in the middle or do I just put my foot down

471,0,I think    F  that my boyfriend     M  and I aren t going to work out long term  but our lease is another   monthsSo my boyfriend and I have been together for almost   years  I definitely think that he s an amazing person  but recently our relationship has been grating on me   Over the last year or so  I ve been more and more bothered by the level I have to care for him  I buy most of our food  clean the apartment  cook dinner  drive him whenever I can  and have covered him on rent multiple times  I also feel like we have different expectations when it comes to sex  I m more of a every day kind of gal  and he is not  All of this has lead to a huge discontentment in my mind about our relationship   I have talked to him about this at length  Every time we have this conversation  it always goes back to how we don t have that much time together  I have a fairly demanding job that has kept us on somewhat opposite schedules for the last couple of years  I feel like when I talk to him he just tells me what I want to hear and always ends up beating himself up about it  It s come to the point where I don t really want to tell him how I m truly feeling because I know it will just cause a spiral in his mood    I have agreed to try couple therapy  There was a groupon near us for   sessions at a discounted rate  Now I know   sessions isn t a lot  and I honestly don t have a lot of hope for it to work  I think that he thinks if we go to this therapist all of our issues will magically be fixed  I think that it s a lot deeper than that   I don t know if I can spend the rest of my life with someone that I have to take care of constantly and receive next to nothing in return  I don t know if I can handle having sex once every other week for the rest of my life  I also have questions about who I am  because I did get with him fairly quickly after my last breakup  I m not      sure if I m monogamous  I ve talked to him about that in the past also and wanting to explore my bisexuality more  He s always said that it s a  cross that bridge when we get there  kind of situation  but I don t know if that s good enough for me anymore   My biggest concern right now is that I don t necessarily want to string him along  but our current lease doesn t end until September  I don t want either of us to end up homeless  but I also don t know if I should continue to try when my brain is telling me it s not worth it  Do I just throw away this relationship  or should I actually give it a go since I m stuck in the lease anyway 
472,0,Am I falling out of love or are my feelings completely natural Hi  I m    and I m in my first steady relationship with my girlfriend  We have been dating for around   months and I ve started to question my feelings for her    The first four months of our relationship had been great  we went on dates fairly consistently  we talked all the time  and everyone always commented on us being  so cute   However  in the last month  she started working     days a week  given that she is the current valedictorian of our highschool this was a LOT of time   and we didn t go on a date or see eachother outside of class for about   weeks  This was a time of frustration for me  as she was able to ask for less hours  yet for some reason refused  She would keep herself up untill near  am and then wake up at  am almost daily  This left me with an emotion I hadn t really experienced prior  which I can only describe as a kind of hole  want  or a need that I have no idea what for   Eventually  we managed to sneak in a date in a day that she wasn t scheduled  We had a good time playing Mario party and doing standard couple stuff  I genuinely had a good time  but for some reason I still had that hole as she was there  Come Monday and in one of our classes she had what I could only describe as an anxiety attack in and began to pull out hair and press her nails into her skin  This really unsettled me and it still does to thing about it  yet it only fueled that hole  A week and a half later I still do the same things I ve always done with her and try not to act like anything has changed but I feel terrible almost all the time and I ve gotten multiple comments from people asking if I m ok    Love gurus of Reddit I need your advice  is this all normal in a relationship  or am I falling out of love

474,0,My    M  soulmate    F  and in a really rough patch and I don t know what to doI don t know what to do and it s tearing me up  Basically we have been together a year and a half and she is literally the perfect girl  She is extremely loyal and kind and never does anything to hurt me and actively tries to avoid hurting me at all costs  We had a great relationship up until a few months ago when she started as an executive at her college  We live in Australia so its not as bad as USA college culture but its similar  Since then we have been goign through a real rough time and just can t shake it  She goes to events anad has to socialise and hangout with guys from the other colleges who naturally want to be with her sexually and some people even romantically want her  I know almost      that that isnt going to happen and the only doubt is because I was cheated on in the past  Whenever she goes out I feel extremely anxious because when these guys who are her friends make sleezy moves on her she tells me she can t really call them out because then her college will have a bad rep and the guys will say shes crazy and that they weren t making a play for her  It makes me feel really low when she doesn t say something to them and when she continues to be friends with these guys even though they obviously either want to fuck her or date her  I recently have been diagnosed with depression which is really making my mood way worse all the time and because of it I have been down and withheld lately  Again I can t stress enough how much of a great person she is and that she s willing to do anything to make things better for us  but its just this one aspect of her life for the rest of the year that is really horrible for me  I don t want to be that guy who tells her what to do  but I also don t know if I can keep this up for the year until things go back to being less intense for us  I know she is the best girl in the world for me  Like we are compatible on literally everything and its so unbelievable  which is why it makes this decision so hard for me  I honestly can t imagine a better person for me but when it s hard like this and I begin to revert back to my self harm tendencies  I just don t know what to do  Do I try and make things work  Have been trying for about two months now and its noot helping  or do I have to face the fact that I might have to leave the person who is literally my soulmate   tl dr Perfect relationship in turmoil because of jealousy and don t know what to do regarding breaking up with the best girl in the world for me

476,0,Did my crazy ex scare off my new boyfriend or is that just an excuse The title says it all but let me back up    I was in a seriously emotionally abusive relationship for ten years with my psycho ex husband  PX  and we have two small children together  He would always leave  cheat  empty out our bank account  demand a divorce and then come back after a few weeks or months  I let him do this to me for years  This last time last year he left and demanded that we sell our house and was on board with a divorce  signed the papers willingly and everything   By the summer I had to find a new home for me and my kids and he was off doing whatever it is he does  By late fall  the divorce was final    Around the same time  I met a guy  BF  online  we re both in our   s  and we hit it off  We talked all the time and had an amazing time when we could meet up  he works out of state most of the time   We ve been going strong for the most part albeit kind of fast as I d say we re pretty serious after only six months  We ve met each other s kids  taken a short vacation together  have two other trips planned for the summer    with the kids and   just the two of us   talked about the future and have been saying I Love You for a little while    He was adamant at the beginning that he wanted a commitment but didn t want to get married again because he had been so emotionally and financially devastated in his divorce    years ago   Considering my past I was totally ok with it  But lately he s been talking about marriage  referring to things as  ours  and going into more detail with plans for the future  Early on he was honest and said he was out of practice with relationships and his deep feelings for me scared him   But before he left town this past time he had his mail forwarded to my house  left some stuff for safe keeping  and gave me a couple grand in cash to take care of some bills for him    Well of course  like always  PX decided he was ready to come home right before the divorce was final and I refused to relent  I went through with it and he got angry  This was before I got together with BF  When he found out about BF  he lost it  He threatened to take my kids  light my house on fire and would say he was on his way to my house in the middle of the night when he lives almost   hours away  This has continued for the last six months and I ve failed twice to get a protective order    Fast forward to last week  kids were on Spring Break and were supposed to go to PX but after two days he sent them home in hopes of ruining my plans  Some other stuff went down that I don t want to include on here but suffice it to say it s pretty dramatic for a grown man in his   s    Well  BF came home from a job last week and things were great  Talked about all the future stuff and we had a good time the first night  But he refused to spend the night because of PX and concern he d show up and start stuff if he saw his car at my house  I was disappointed but understood  The next day we went out with the kids and had a good time  Over the weekend I noticed he wasn t texting me like he normally would and was only sending me short responses to texts I would initiate  By the end of the weekend I had lost my patience and told him so  I didn t receive a response all day until that evening where he said he was backing off until things settled down with my ex  We got into a small argument about it being a break up and he reiterated his concerns especially considering what had happened recently    Then nothing for two days  I caved and sent a text asking about his mail and he responded with a non sequitur side conversation that completely avoided the question  It was brief so I said I was going to bed and still needed him to tell me what he wanted to do about the mail  All he said was  good night    It s been another two days of radio silence and I m confused  Based on a gut feeling I checked Tinder and Bumble and he has profiles up on both  If he wants it to be over  why avoid the question about your stuff  In my heart I feel and hope he s just a little overwhelmed with everything and needs time to figure out if this is what he really wants  But at the same time I m too old to play games and want an answer either way  I m willing to give him space if he wants to work it out but if he s on Tinder and wants it over then just tell me so I can stop hanging out in limbo  We went from     to   in    seconds and I have a hard time believing he doesn t have true feelings for me especially with all the entanglements we have made together    What could he be thinking and should I reach out to him for an answer  Should I give him more time and how much is enough before I deserve resolution    TL DR Ex husband is psycho and harassing me and new boyfriend went from completely loving to wanting space in a weekend  He says it s because of the ex or is it just a cop out

478,0,Looking at gore and dead bodies since girlfriend and I took break I ve been with her for four years  recently we took a break  It started with me saying we should take some time for ourselves  after an incident happened  Time has gone by  I feel it has been forever  I have talked to her and she d like to take more time  I m a very empathetic person  I love my animals  my sisters  and I just love giving love  After we took a break though  I haven t been able to eat normally  or sleep  I ve been feeling very depressed  and suicide has been on my mind  Tonight for the first time  I looked up pictures of dead bodies  To my surprise  there are many websites dedicated to just this with over        members on the site I visited  After looking at these pictures  my sadness felt a bit less worse than it did  I then started reading stories about boyfriends who have killed themselves from girlfriends breaking up with them  This comforted it me as well  I would not act on any of this  nor do I plan to kill myself  let alone have ever even attempted it  I m not sure if this is a color mechanism  or looking at the extremes of ideas in my mind  
479,0,I am a    year old female and am wondering if these actions from my now    year old male dad are acceptableI ve never really felt very close to my dad although this is not something that I ve ever expressed to anyone  I have an early memory  It was one of my earliest memories and I think I must have been   years old when this happened and I m    years old now  I remember when I was very little I think I may have felt that my dad was kind of weird  which  if I were to be completely honest  I still think he s kind of a weird guy  and I think I may have been kind of making fun of him in some way  However  remember that I was only a toddler at the time and it is tough for toddlers to understand the world and how we should act and treat others  If anything I was probably just testing the waters  trying to get some reaction  from a person that I knew was supposed to be a good person but to me just came across as kind of odd  I might not have had a lot of respect for him at this time  I don t know exactly what I said on this day  because I don t remember  but I remember going into the kitchen by him and I remember due to my small size I had to look way up to look at him and he expressed this type of scary like anger towards me  I don t remember specifically what was done  and I don t know how to describe it but it was shocking and upset me  that I had never seen from any human and it may have been my first experience of someone being angry  I felt that this behavior of his confirmed my suspicion that something wasn t right with him  I didn t feel it was right for him to treat me that way  It caused me to lose more respect for him because I was his freaking daughter and he just treated me like some disgusting severe enemy of his  Is this the right way to treat your daughter  Anyway  And please excuse me because I don t know how to make paragraphs on Reddit  I remember thinking and feeling to myself that  I don t really need a dad   I was perfectly happy having my mother and I didn t understand this need for a father figure that others in American culture seem to express no offense to any members of the male species reading  I guess on some level I don t really get the appeal of men in general although I am a heterosexual person  I m particularly attracted to Yogi Bear  in fact  and have been since I was seven years old   My ultimate  man  in that regard would be an anthropomorphic male bear to be precise  When the choice is between a human man and a bear with human like intelligence it becomes a very clear choice  Until I can encounter  or genetically create  such a being I m content to be single  So  when I had this experience I could see that my behavior was in the very least greatly not approved  And I also felt on some level that I really didn t like this guy  This experience taught me that I can t communicate in any sort of real way with my dad  I hoped to get along with him at least a little bit from that point forward but  again  I felt like all I really needed in the way of parental connection was that connection that I could  and felt like I did  attain from my mother  My dad in general is a very quiet person who is with us physically but is a passive listener and sometimes will say a pretty good one liner out of the blue  My mother is always bringing the action in our family  My personality is actually more like my dad s and I am physically built more like his side of the family  I have his eyebrows and blue eyes  When it came to my dad  I often felt more like he was my brother rather than my dad  and I only had one sibling  a sister   But I never wished that I could have a dad  like the kind you hear about   That was not something that I felt a need desire for  My dad was also not very much around during my young life because he is a dairy farmer and is at work up the road pretty much always  We didn t vacation often because it was hard for him to get away  I would hang out the most at home with my mother and sister  As I got a little older  like         years old  I felt like daddy didn t exactly like me all that much  I was clearly not the favorite although I believe I was the favorite of my mother which I was totally happy and content with  My mother is my second most favorite person second to Yogi  It wasn t like my dad treated me in any overt way I just could tell that he quite liked my sister  who is a year younger than me  but I didn t feel I received the same love from him  Hashtag bridge burned by a toddler who wouldn t know any better  I guess  And you would think an adult would understand that but no I guess  Things started to get better once we got into the teenage years and middle school I remember him being more pleasant toward me but he was still very distant  Something about my dad that he has issues with  and this is in general not just towards me  is thinking about what he knows in comparison to what someone else knows about something and he doesn t  offer  up information that may be of interest to someone  You have to play    questions  with him he doesn t just offer up all information that he knows that would be helpful to the person he s talking with  I overhear him doing this with my mother and she gets kind of mad about it   Every time you try to ask him something about his personal life like his upbringing or what he did at work that day  which is something I ve rarely done and I ve witnessed that this also happens when my mom talks to him  he seems extremely uncomfortable answering and he says things very slow and like he is trying his best to hold back as much information as possible  I experience this as CREEPY  Why doesn t he want to share about who he is with his closest family members  his wife and daughters  Also  pretty much every time we would go somewhere in town my mom  sister and I would be walking beside each other but my dad would be walking yards behind us  Lately  however  one of the things that has really been sticking out in my mind and bothering me is that one time when I was in middle school I had to get up for school and it was early in the morning and I was very tired on this day and I got out of my bed and went to the bathroom and this was the only bathroom that we had in our house  It was time for me to take my shower but I was so tired on this day that I forgot to lock the bathroom door  I was also so tired that I had taken only my top off so that I was completely naked on top and I sat down on the floor in the bathroom facing sideways to the door and like a nightmare my dad is there and he opened the door  I was so surprised that upon him seeing me in there naked from the waist up that he didn t just immediately shut the door  I remember I was yelling and pleading for him to shut the door but he just kept standing there looking at me I don t think I looked right at him but he kept standing there looking at me  Why would he have done that  I feel totally violated by this and at this time I was busty for a girl my age  I also had a situation where one of my unrelated uncles during this same time period who is married to one of my dad s sisters came in to hug me once from behind and I could sense that he was feeling my boobs with his hands  I didn t say anything about it and to this day I don t really like being around him because of this  Other than these things there haven t been any other problems with my dad  I believe he has been and still is a good husband for my mother  He seems to treat her pretty well and she seems to absolutely adore him  I never spoke about any of these incidents to anyone and I haven t spoken about this to my dad or uncle for that matter  I also live with my parents mainly because it s less expensive for me  There is nothing that i see myself as particularly wanting at this time so I might as well live with them and get rich in the meanwhile  Due to it being difficult for farmers at this time and because my dad is getting older he will be selling the cows this summer and he will be looking for work in town which means he may be at home with us more  It feels like for the first time in forever he is starting to be more a part of the family and I see my mother as treating him like he is the most wonderful person  I m feeling a little bothered  Sorry to be so annoying with this wall of text  I need to fully

482,0,My crush  F    asked me to come to a party tomorrow  How do I go on about this party  M    Both of us are sophomore in college studying the same majorThere s this girl that I recently got feelings for and she invited me to a party tomorrow  I m not sure if she invited me because she s just being friendly and or she s actually into me  I say this because when we walk out of class together she s always being recognized by so many people  They all seem super cool and chill and I think it s so cool that she has so many friends outside of class  So this makes me think she s inviting me because she s just being nice and wants another friend there at the party you know   The more the merrier lmao I guess I need help on how to behave when I get to the party  I don t know anybody there except this girl and I m not sure if she s going to be with all her friends and leave me to mingle with other people or spend time with me  My fear and nervousness comes from facing my own rejection thinking that she was into me but wasn t really  How do I go on about this party   I m so nervous hahahahaha

484,0,Am I making a huge mistake Note  all relevant facts are true  I ve changed some minor details in case a friend of hers sees this  she doesn t use Reddit but most of her friends do    My     m  girlfriend     f  and I are moving in together next month   We ve been dating for    months   We met on a dating app just as I was getting out of a short term  but intense relationship     I was initially pretty guarded  which worked because she s naturally guarded as well   We always had fun together  but this didn t progress all that much early on   I don t know if it was just me being lazy or the fact that I wasn t over my ex  but I just sort of went with the flow and stayed with her despite it taking months to get out of first gear in the relationship   Fast forward a bit and I start having some real feelings for her   Things weren t perfect  but she s smart  funny  beautiful   everything I could ever want   These aren t the intense feelings I had experienced with exes  but I figure that s ok   after all  those never worked out     After about a year  we start talking about moving in together   given our ages  and the fact that we want kids  it was time to shit or get off the pot   We just signed for an apartment last week  and we move in next month     However  since we signed the lease my feelings for her have changed   I m less excited to spend time with her   Nothing has changed with respect to our interactions  but I m suddenly not sure this is the right thing for us     I just can t tell if this is me freaking out about fully committing to her moving in together us likely getting married  or if I really am not sure about us   I ve felt pretty empty inside since we signed the lease  but it s too late to go back on that  we deposited a lot of money and neither of us can afford the rent on our own    Maybe we just need to move in and I can assess the situation better once we re both in the same space all the time     Has anybody else experienced anything like this

486,0, M    have a crush on  F    but I have little social skills and dont know how Im supposed to do anything without seeming creepy or hollowContext  I ve had a crush on a classmate way above my league  I m one of the nerdy kids who doesn t know shit when it comes to the world and how things work who s found at the bottom of the social ladder while she s more than a few rungs above  for about    years now  I made the mistake of telling some people that I liked her and before long it spread across my year and most if not all  including her  know about it  This was my first mistake  Once this was out I received the obligatory ribbing for it and mentioning of it with a raised voice when she was in earshot  As someone who would rather not be in the spotlight I hated it  I knew it was never going to come to fruition and so in an attempt to shut myself and others up  I made my second mistake  I asked her if I was to  hypothetically ask her out  what would she say   At the time I thought nothing of it because I didn t want to actually ask her out but just get the no in response I needed  Turns out that was a bad idea  Much like the fact that I liked her  news of my stupidity spread  However I had  or so I thought  convinced myself that that was that  I didn t like her anymore  This was about a year and a half ago  Recently I began thinking about her again and realised I never stopped   The Issue  Everyday I hope for some kind of situation in which I can talk with her  Mostly this doesn t happen or if it does it s something meaningless like checking something to do with classwork and such  I feel like a creep but I try to time my journey home in hope I can end up walking part of it with her  I want to tell her I like her hair or something but I m too scared to initiate a conversation when others are there because I ve spent a year trying to convince myself and others that I don t like her anymore   I get butterflies when I m around her but can make the meaningless conversation responses just fine but when I want to say the things worth saying I can t  I feel like compliment would come across as partially hollow because she knows I like her  Same with reaching out on social media  I can t find anyway to talk to her that s not purely driven by wanting to talk to her because I like her  Because I don t engage with her that much because of all this I end up just observing and mentally noting knowledge about her but then I feel creepy stalkerish  What do I do  I know the obvious things are just talk to her or something but I can never actually didn t ways to talk without feeling like it becomes hollow and meaningless because I like her 
487,0,I    F  can t leave my boyfriend    M  alone when he hangs out with his friends This is a me problem and it s not really about him but I d still like advice  Over the past few months I ve lost all of my friends and my boyfriend is the only person that I hang out with anymore  He s my whole support system and since I m not in school anymore I feel lonely and bored most days even while working full time    I text my boyfriend constantly because I don t have anyone else to talk to honestly but I can tell that I m annoying him  We ve been together for about a year and half  Whenever he doesn t reply I always get lowkey upset because he s already not a great texter    Today we were hanging out and I mentioned something about him hardly texting me back and he got upset with me and told me that he shouldn t have to text me back constantly when he s with his friends  Which is true but I m still struggling with it    I want him to be able to spend time with his friends and not be worried upset when he doesn t immediately text me back  Does anyone have any advice 
488,0,My    F  boyfriend    M  blindsided me with doubts about our relationship  despite having been looking at moving in together this April Forgive me  I am typing this on my phone  but I am lost and need advice  Warning  this is long   So  I met boyfriend in fall       We did the fwb thing for about   months  with me developing the feelings first  I told him how I felt  and he said he didn t reciprocate  I ended all things benefit related and we remained acquaintances  I moved on    or so I thought    months later  he confessed he had feelings for me and realized what a huge mistake he had made the first go around  We rekindled things and have been committed ever since   Fast forward to now  We ve been together for    year and things seemed to be going well  Neither of us necessarily want to have the white picket fence  golden retriever      kids and the all American dream  Instead  valuing adventure and experience overall  His goal is to finish the last year of his degree  he already has a great job lined up for after graduation  I went with him  met his parents and siblings and they all reportedly liked me  He has met my family  and they say that they like him  despite being a little rough around the edges  We have discussed his family life growing up  which was pretty rough  dad leaving mom in deep depression   he even cried  Boyfriend is a very stoic person  raised in a  men don t cry  household  so that was huge for him  We have travelled all around our country together  he makes me laugh like nobody else  we have fun together and he just genuinely makes me happy  I love him so much  my heart could explode thinking about it  I had been working in a different city  but when things started to get more serious  and I got a new  better job   I moved back to the place we originally met late January  This past year has been a particularly hard one for me  dealing with a deep depression around Christmas last year and he was there for me the whole time  We have been talking about getting our own place  going so far as to plan when and start looking at places together    However  there are some things about us individually that we have found difficult to surpass    Boyfriend likes to drink  drinking at least   whiskeys night  It should be noted that this was not the norm when we first started dating  it became part of his routine about   months ago  after a particularly difficult time at work  He cusses like a sailor  which doesnt bother me except for when it s directed at somebody  then I get cringey  Conversely  boyfriend says I nag him too much about his swearing and drinking  that he is an adult and should be able to  have a few beers after work if he wants to   He also is upset that I nag him about travelling internationally  saying I talk about it too much and nag him to do it with me  When we argue  boyfriend takes the  silent treatment  role whereas I like to talk things out  Boyfriend can be pretty confrontational harsh and sometimes it hurts my feelings  Boyfriend says he doesn t mean to hurt my feelings  but feels like he is constantly hurting them and finds it hard to not feel like he is walking on eggshells    I m currently away and prior to leaving we had a stupid tiff over food  We didn t sort it out and I left for the week  I ve been away for   days now and it s been radio silence from him  I texted him twice  the first relatively calmly telling him to text when ready on day    second time basically demanding that he answer me if he even cares at all on day    He said he doesn t want to talk to me  refuses to call me or facetime  He mentions all the things above and says he is  wondering if we are doing the right thing by being together  if we feel those things  He still refuses to discuss any further  I ask if we are done  he says  I don t know   I say we shouldn t make any decisions until I m back and we can discuss face to face  but that I can t go the rest of the trip not talking  He says we can talk a bit over text  and that he is in a bad mood with a recent change at work where he is feeling like a  newbie  again    I m honestly so lost  Like  we had an argument over fucking FOOD and now this could be the end of the relationship  I don t even know what to do  think  say to him  Am I missing something  or is this just not adding up  What do I do   TLDR  Got into an argument with my boyfriend before vacation  now he s telling me he doesn t know if we should be together in between giving the silent treatment  We ve been together a year and were planning to move in together in April 
489,0,Im stumped in the friend zoneAround Halloween of last year I asked a girl out that I have been friends with for a while she said no because she wanted to stay friends and I truly believe that  but we have been friends ever since we got each other s number and started a  Bible devotional that we do every day  Then the other day she said that she doesn t see me as a dating option but as a friend  And I had gotten over her but this and a couple of other things have spiraled me down to a sad state  I was wondering if there was a way out of the  friend zone  as people call it 
490,0,How to spice up daily conversationI ve been with my boyfriend for almost   months now and things are great  We talk every day through text and see each other about twice a week  But I m starting to feel like it s me who carries the conversation all the time  I keep seeing funny posts about people messaging each other and one complaining of a sore back or having to go to the hospital for is carrying the conversation  I want to say this to him but don t want him to be offended either  Should I just talk to him and suggest we message each other less or mention that I m the only one making conversation  Lately he keeps saying  haha xx  to things I m saying which I m getting a bit bored of    Any suggestions on things we could talk about 
491,0,I m    F  jealous because my boyfriend    M  looks at nudes and watches porn when we barely have sex  Should I initiate a conversation about this  if so how In the past we would have sex regularly and so him watching porn didn t bother me  Now we have sex maybe   or   times a month and it usually doesn t last for very long   under    minutes  No foreplay  no kissing  and lots of lube  due to lack of foreplay    I give what he claims to be amazing Bj s quite frequently  yet he very rarely performs oral on me or anything else  I just dont get it  I m attractive  men hit on me often  I m very clean and kept  But I don t have big boobs  only B s  Nice bum though     I feel like he d rather watch porn than have sex with me and now I feel insecure about myself and deprived sexually  I ve even thought about getting implants to look more like the girls he watches and to feel more desired by him  but that s not my style   I ve talked to him twice already about how this makes me feel and what I need from him   which isn t necessarily to stop watching porn  but to give me more sexual attention  We ve been unsuccessful each time weve discussed this because he ends up feeling like he s not satisfying my needs  which hurts his ego  and subsequently causes him to have sex with me less   I really love him and I know he loves me  We ve been together for   years and every other aspect about our relationship is gold I wouldn t change a thing   Should I bring it up again  If so  any thoughts on how to approach the discussion

498,0,I     F   am very worried that the kid I tutor     m  has a crush on me and that I might have accidentally groomed him to be that way So  I have been working for the same family as a tutor since starting college when I was     I tutor the family s   boys and  all three go to very rigorous private schools so they have a huge amount of studying to do on a daily basis  My job there is  basically full time         days a week  and if my boss  their mom  could get me them to work on Fridays  I d be there then too  Anyways  the job s had it s ups and tons of downs     but as of now I m pretty comfortable with all three of the kids    I ve basically watched them grow up  and their mom likes to say she thinks as me as her daughter  although I personally only see her and her family as the people I work for   which I know sounds kind of mean but it s just too much to explain why and anyways not relevant to this   Anyways  about   or so years ago  I noticed the middle brother    who I work with the least because he s by far the most independent with his hw studying    was super affectionate touchy whenever I worked with him  Like he would always be staring at me or he would try and put his head in my lap  or he would offer me a back massage  or if he was sitting on the ground and I walked by  he would hold my ankle and try to pull me down on top of him  So I told his mom that I thought that he had a crush on me and she totally dismissed it  She said that she had suspected the same thing but that he insisted he only saw me like a sister  And then she said how happy she was that he saw me that way bc she considered me part of her family blah blah blah whatever  So I just accepted that it was just him being playful like a little brother   Fast forward to this year  He s    now  and out of all the brother s he s the one I genuinely care for the most    I almost DO wish he was my actual little brother because he really is turning out to be a decent kid  When we re working together he ll ask me for advice and I m just glad to be someone he can come to for things if he s feeling unsure  And all the while he s still kind of affectionate but not like he was before with the putting his head in my lap and stuff  more like putting his arm around me sometimes  I m pretty sure his parents told him doing all that was inappropriate   But there are still things like    he ll ask if I have a boyfriend  and when I was dating someone he seemed upset and asked a lot if I was  locked down  with the guy  And he ll always bring up how our age difference isn t that much  pointing out like Priyanka Chopra Nick Jonas  Stormi Bree Lucky Blue  now Pete Davidson and Kate Beckinsale etc etc  He s always asking what my ideal type of guy is    I mentioned that I liked short hair on guys and he got his hair cut short  I mean these all could be coincidences curiosity  but one time we were sitting next to each other at an appropriate distance  and when I left and came back  he had PULLED MY CHAIR so it was RIGHT NEXT to his  That was NOT a coincidence  I m not stupid  I know he pulled that chair   Most recently however  his mom has decided that he doesn t need much help anymore  so she has me handle his younger brother  and if he does need help  she ll call in a back up tutor  It s not my decision at all who I work with  but he confronted me and accused me of purposely not wanting to work with him for      some reason  I have no idea   He will just get so moody if my schedule changes or if one of his other brothers have too much work so I don t get to work with him    and like I know he s upset  because I ve known him for four years  But then when I do work with him    he s just so happy  He s always smiling  he s in such a good mood  He gets that look in his eye     it s just THE LOOK  The look a guy has when he s really into someone  Like I know that look  And I know this kid  and he gets it  and I feel terrible that I ve lead him on somehow   Bascially  I m just so so so so worried that I ve messed up this poor child  He should have a crush on someone his own age  There s a girl at his school who ADORES him    why can t he like her  I just want to tell him to stop having a crush on me but at the same time I highly doubt he would admit to having one    and there s always the possibility that these are all coincidences and he does not  I m thinking about telling his mom  but she might just say it s the sister thing again  She s also kind of possessive over her kids   I do not think she would take well to any of them having a crush on anyone  At the same time  I m going to be leaving this job in June   and I m not planning on keeping in contact with their family  Should I just wait it out  But then if I leave and never address it and also cut off contact  will it mess him up even more  Will he feel abandoned or betrayed  The last thing I want to do is hurt him that way    amp  x   B   TL DR  I think the kid I tutor likes me and I need to figure out how to stop him from doing that without hurting his feelings
499,0,I need advice on this one
500,0,My    M  girlfriend    F  is really needy clingy and I m not sure how to handle it For some context  this is my first relationship and my girlfriend s second relationship and we met at school  This is my first relationship so i m typing this to gain some perspective but i do apologize if it seems like im venting    I like my girlfriend very much but one thing is she is really clingy needy  While i don t mind her being clingy to a certain degree  sometimes it gets so  bad  that it ends up affecting her mood and subsequently my mood  For example today we were studying and i stepped away for    minutes to make a call  I told her i ll be back in a bit and went to do my thing  From then on i noticed throughout the day she was being a bit more  distant  and it was obvious she was sad    During lunch i asked her what was bothering her but she refused to tell me  And being the person i am  if i see my girlfriend sad  i myself get upset to the point where because she refused to tell me  i was in an bad mood  It was only after she went home when she told me she was upset because i left for the    minutes    The thing is  this isn t a one time occurrence but has happened quite a bit within the one month we ve been dating  I was the only child growing up so I am sort of use to being  alone  and doing my own thing  We ve had talks about this and she knows that she is being very clingy but i feel she isnt doing much to change that   if she has to change that   I guess my question  reddit  is what can i do about this    PS  for a bit more context  we do live far away from each other  about an hours drive and are both in a very intensive program at school  During the weekdays we do see each other at school and get lunch and dinner most of the days  i d say at least     weekdays   Most sundays we meet up and study together
501,0,I    M  Choose to watch basketball instead of attending my girlfriends    F  birthday dinnerThrow away account but essentially here s the jist   My    M  Girlfriend s    F  Birthday was today and she asked me yesterday if I would join her and her mother for dinner to celebrate her birthday  I turned her down stating that I had planned to watch the NCAA basketball games with my friends  which I had also mentioned to her the day before when discussing plans for the weekend  It is also worth mentioning that in the past week I have traveled to Miami with her for a   day vacation where we stayed with my father at his condo and had a great time  during which I did many nice things for her all of which I paid for  I also got her and myself massages the day we returned as part of her birthday gift  This upcoming weekend I told her of extensive plans I had for us  involving taking her to dinner then going out with a group of our friends  and finally spending Sunday evening together as well watching a movie and sharing a bottle of wine  All of this seemed to be forgotten when I declined her invitation to dinner tonight with her mother  I understand it is her birthday and she wants to have dinner with me but am I the asshole for turning her down even after all the nice things I did and plan to do for her birthday  I also mentioned that I would come over to her house after the dinner to spend the night with her    TLDR  My Girlfriend was pissed at me when I turned her down for her birthday dinner to watch basketball with my friends  even though I told her I couldn t have dinner today anyway  and went to great lengths to plan special events for the weekend to celebrate her birthday anyway

508,0,My     m  girlfriend     f  and I went on a weekend trip with a group of friends and encountered an awkward situation  Need advice on how to deal with it My girlfriend  let s call her Jane  and I have been dating for the past   months  and for the most part  things have been going pretty well  We get along well  share many of the same fundamental values  and have similar personality types  both pretty introverted   For the record  I am an ISTJ and she is an INTJ  Things have been going well enough that we ve talked about marriage and even went ring shopping together   This past weekend  Jane and I went together on a weekend trip  Sat Mon  to another city together with a group of my friends totaling    people  She doesn t know most of them too well  met most of them once or twice   and it s our first overnight trip together other than visiting family  The first two days of the trip  Sat  amp  Sun  went well and we had a good time  On Monday morning  our last day of the trip together  one of my friends  let s call him John  told me in private that some of my friends on the trip have been a bit uncomfortable with the amount of PDA that Jane and I have shown  there were a few other couples on the trip but they weren t as touch feely   I was a bit taken aback  but he stressed to me that it wasn t a big deal and he only told me because it could be helpful for future interactions  not just for this trip specifically  He said that he was telling me this only because he cares about me as a friend  Also he said that it s better I know since there was some talk among everyone  When I asked him who specifically said they were uncomfortable  John told me that it was honestly everyone  I thanked him for telling me and told him that I appreciated it  I was especially struck at the time because this was not the first time I was told Jane and I had a bit too much PDA  My parents and sister had told me that when Jane and I visited them before  but I just chalked it up at the time to them being conservative family members  Now John and I have a really strong friendship for many years and we ve always kept it real between each other  I trust him completely and know that he was telling me this not to shame me but truly because he cares about me  John also mentions that he could understand why Jane was maybe a bit more clingy this weekend  since she s in an unfamiliar place with people who she doesn t know well except me  It may also be due to a difference in culture  Jane is Caucasian but I am Asian and most of my friends on the trip are Asian as well   However  John told me that he still felt that it would be good for me to hear since it may come up again in the future   Afterwards  I talked to Jane privately and told her that John had told me some friends on the trip were a bit uncomfortable with the level of PDA  and asked if we could tone it down a bit  I told her that I still really like her  just that we should be considerate of others and it would be best if we cool it down a little for the rest of the trip  I could tell she was instantly very upset and even shed a couple tears  She said that she had no idea and thought that my friends must now have a bad impression of her  and it was one of the worst scenarios she was afraid of happening  She was also upset that people would gossip about us and that John was being a jerk for telling me  She said John was just being bitter and that he doesn t even know her well  and that he has no right to  give advice  about our relationship  Jane said she was just beginning to get to know my friends and wanted to make a good impression  but she can t believe they would just judge her and not give her the benefit of the doubt  She called it unfair and even said that there were a couple things that also made her uncomfortable but she kept it to herself  like a few people drinking a bit more than she liked or that some people stayed up too late which affected her sleeping   When I told her that John was just telling me this because he cares for us and with no other motive  she said that she just sees it a different way    She did admit that even she thought she was a bit extra clingy this trip  but also complained that the level of PDA isn t that much  to be fair  we were just cuddling holding hands and one time she sat on my lap  but there were no making out   She said she was a bit more clingy because she didn t really know anyone besides me there  Also in her experience  her sisters and other couples she know display just as much PDA if not more and it was fine  I told her I understand her point of view and that I don t think she did anything wrong or that it was a big deal  but just that we should try to be more considerate of other s feelings  For the rest of the day  I could tell that this issue was obviously occupying her mind  I know physical affection is important to her  it s one of her love languages   but if everyone was feeling a bit uncomfortable  there was probably some truth to their feelings    The next evening  Tuesday  after the trip  John called me and told me he wanted to talk about something  He said that Jane had directly messaged him and basically told him  I don t know you well and it would have been better if you had not given advice to  my name  about our relationship   I was a bit surprised because I didn t think she was upset enough to do that  And while it wasn t the harshest message  I thought it was a bit abrasive and direct  I apologized to him for Jane and asked him to not take it to heart  He was very cool about it and said that it didn t really bother him that much  Till now  Jane hasn t brought it up to me that she messaged him and I haven t brought it up that I know either    I m not sure what to make of this situation or what to do now  It s bothering me a little because it seems Jane doesn t take criticism too well  and that she even messaged John directly without telling me  She has always had strong worldviews and strong sense of what she thinks is right and wrong  For the most part  we align well on our worldviews  we are both very Christian  but it s hard not to be bothered by the fact that she would respond poorly to constructive criticism  I can understand why she feels the way she does  but just doesn t sit right with me that she would message such a direct response to John without consulting me and after I told her that I fully trust John s motive was pure    Questions      Should I reach out to my friends and apologize for making them uncomfortable  And also explain that it was because Jane didn t know too people too well on the trip and so was a bit out of character      Should I bring up with Jane that I know of her message to John  Should I confront her about it  If so  what should I say       Do you see this incident more as an isolated event or does it open up bigger questions that I should talk with Jane about   Thank you guys so much for reading  really appreciate any advice or feedback

510,0,Will I    M  ever find a new girlfriend after my ex    F  Hey everyone   So I recently got out of an extremely toxic relationship with my ex girlfriend   It was my first girlfriend and mistakes were definitely made   We go to the same small college and even lived in the same house last semester  so I still have to deal with some of her pettiness even months after SHE broke up with ME   She will do things such as be very touchy with guys in front of me to try and make me jealous and even spread some rumors about things I never did to her   Anyway  she immediately hooked up with a ton of guys in a short amount of time and I still have yet to find another girl and it upsets me   I am still a virgin and am also a slight introvert  so I feel as if I will never be able to find another girl again   Is there any way you guys could help me out   
511,0,My   M  Girlfriend   F  Bores Me  at times So I m   M and my girlfriend is   F  She s a really great person and I like a lot of things about her  she s my type physically   short  athletic body type  long hair   we have a similar sense of humor  she s very genuine  caring  pretty good sex life  etc but there s one thing that frustrates me a lot when I m with her    She talks about  in my opinion  boring stuff too often    she ll tell me unnecessary uninteresting details about how her day was  especially over text   she always wants to text  or complain about trivial things that don t matter in the grand scheme of things  I feel bad because I want to care about how her day was and support her if she s complaining about stuff but I really just don t care to hear it   Of course I don t tell her this and I try to be as supportive as possible for her  Also I mostly feel this way if she talks about it too much  which  again  in my opinion  is most of the time   but if it was once in a while I definitely wouldnt mind hearing it   I think part of the issue is because I m not the type of person to share a lot about my life or day to day activities because    I don t think they are interesting topics to talk about it and    I m also very laid back and introverted to the point that if I get some  big news  or if something bad happens to me  I don t really feel the need to tell people about it    I tend to just go with the flow or move past things very quickly  So having a SO who always wants to share every little detail of her life with me gets on my nerves sometimes   Side note  She has close friends who she talks to and shares stuff with as well but she prefers sharing stuff with me    aren t I lucky lol   Other things to add      She s not particularly smart so we don t have the best intellectual conversations which frustrates me at times because I enjoy having such discussions      She wants me to text her nonstop basically and spend a lot of time with her and I prefer to have space  especially because I work at a stressful job full time  She works too but she s part time currently     Edit  I also felt this way with every other relationship just not as much because they didn t talk about that stuff as often  I ve just never been very interested in hearing about people s day or listening to complaining unless there was something significant that happened     amp  x   B   Yea so I know I sound like an asshole but I want to know if there s anything I can do to improve the relationship without hurting her and telling her that I don t want to hear about how her day is or text her non stop  Or let me know whether you guys think this just wouldn t work out in the long run   TLDR  I m dating a wonderful girl but there s   glaring issue I have which is that she overshares about her life and is too needy for my taste  I would prefer we have more interesting topics of conversation but I don t know how to tell her this without upsetting her  Not sure if the relationship is a good fit in the long run 
512,0,I broke up with a girl five months ago  i have a fling with friend  That friend is feeling guilty and wants to end things  i like this friend alot  what do i do I was my ex for    months  It really wasn t working out because of some lies she told and crazy things she did   Ie  lying about pregnancy stuff and being very possessive  I was miserable and after trying to fix things multiple times I broke up with her  I did it in a mature way but she tried to ruin my life afterwards because she claimed to love me and that I hated her etc    She also started doing drugs and letting her grades slip  I was kind of taking care of her  which isn t good for any relationshio  I cared about her in a friend way after the breakup but then I started to dislike her after all the trash talking she did about her best friends and me plus all the times she would date her friends crushes  After breaking up  she tries to sleep with my best friend  I was mad at friend for not telling me about it  I didn t really care what my ex did though   I forgave that friend  Fast forward   months  me and ex are on civil terms  however I know she shit talks me behind my back in addition to shit talking other friends  I hang out with ex s best friend  we will call her Sarah  ex says stuff about me to Sarah which wasn t true  Sarah ends friendship  Later after realizing the Ex s manipulation  Sarah apologizes to me  We become friends again  Ex goes after Sarah s crush knowing full well Sarah likes him  That Sarah s old crush and ex are possibly dating or hooking up behind Sarahs back  Sarah and I get really close  We would talk on the phone for ours without running out of things to say  watch childhood movies and overall just built a really good friendship  While at my place we decided to cuddle and we ended up kissing and hooking up  It wasn t my intention for that to end up this way but I started to really like her  We have been secret about it for a week but Sarah feels really guilty and wants to end things  I really like this girl and want to have a relationship with her  I feel like my ex always tries to crawl back into my life and ruin things  whether through manipulation or other tactics  Right now me and Sarah are friends with benefits  as we just started hooking up   I think if I confess my feelings she ll stay and we can tell everyone about a relationship and stop being secretive  I promised myself after my ex I wouldn t have a relationship for a while but this girl is special and I couldn t help catching feelings  As my ex and I haven t dated for   months  we are over eachother and have been mostly out of eachothers lives  We even recently had a talk talking about what went wrong and she apologized for being controlling and for a bunch of other stuff  We even agreed on not controlling who we date  I want to tell my ex and everyone about Sarah so that we are being honest despite any hurt feelings  Sarah feels guilty and I feel bad for putting her in that position  however it seems we both like eachother and I want it to work  I hate how this is like a teen drama and I wish we could all just be mature and honest about all our feelings  Any advice on what to do or at least how I can keep this special girl around  My ex has done mean things to Sarah and I honestly wish Sarah wouldn t care about her friend and choose me  However I don t want to put her in that position because that s an asshole thing to do  I ve been super sad thinking about whether Sarah will end things or not  I just want an ultimatum  Any advice on how to deal with all this 
513,0,I  M    am looking for ways to break the ice with my GF  F   So i ve been dating this girl for a week now  about two weeks ago on Saturday we met while I was absolutely hammered at a party and she was decently drunk as well   We started messaging after the party and tuesday the week after I took her to a crepe restaurant in the city because I wanted to go anyway and I thought it d be a nice place to go for lunch   So after i took her to that restaurant it was clear we both had a clear interest in each other and she asked me out that same day  I felt like this was definitely rushing things but in my head was like  I dunno when im going to get this chance again so fuck it  and said yes to her proposal because I really like her   Now this week thursday ive gone over to her house for the first time and we watched movies for most of the afternoon  things feel good and I still feel like she has an interest in me  but we re both very introverted people so conversation is pretty light overall   How do I get us over this communication barrier and make things feel more casual  as currently I feel we re both carefully selecting our words to not embarrass ourselves   Is this just something that improves over time or something that i should be worried about  we ve only been in this relationship for a week and known each other for two weeks so I understand that we d not be      comfortable with each other   Edit  Just an addendum about something im worried about  this is my first relationship and I went from talking to this girl to her asking me out two days later  could it have been a mistake to say yes to her asking me out

517,0,I    M  Have been so distraught over my last relationship that I attempted suicide  and things have not improved Im going to start off by saying that I dont talk to people about my issues  parents and friends have tried to convince me to go to seek  help  but I have no will to do so  I am posting this to reddit over fear that if things do not get better  I might regress to my previous state    amp  x   B   I began dating this girl     F   around sophomore year of hs  and within     months of dating it was rather apparent to me that she was not enjoying the relationship as a whole  and ultimately broke it off with me as a result  She then proceeded to block me from all forms of contact  and cease talking to me  I felt horrible and even comparable to my current state as I do now  I learned after a couple months that she had begun dating another guy  who was renowned for his general lack of kindness and his drug alcohol issues  I will not stand on a soap box  but I consider myself to be a rather enjoyable person to be around  I have a great network of friends and as far as i know none of them have any sort of gripe with me  I have never used any drugs or been hurtful to anyone in any intentional form    She dated this person for a few months and again refused to attempt contact with me  then one day out of the blue decided to message me again  just sending memes or casual conversation  after several weeks of this our senior prom rolled around and she showed up with no date  and by the end of the night had asked me to dance  where I learned that she and her SO had recently split  It was no secret at this point to friends and family that I had intentions to enlist  and was fully contempt to do so  and over the ensuing   month countdown to my ship date we had reconnected  and eventually started dating again  and I mean a real relationship where both parties are happy and contempt  I shipped out to RTC in June of last year  and was just getting used to boot camp when the shit hit the fan  I was on guard duty one night when I was sexually assaulted in the bathroom head  It wrecked me  I was forced into review sessions on base and they ultimately decided to separate me  I pleaded for weeks with the CO and review board to allow me to continue training but I had no say in the matter and was removed in the end  When I returned home I was visibly changed  not in terms of physique but rather in emotion  I initially put a lot of effort into keeping the relationship strong with her but something inside me began to crash  and i started to stop communicating with friends and even my girlfriend to a degree  It got so bad that one night she showed up crying and we had mutually decided to end the relationship  and keep in mind that her and all others aside from my parent and I were not told of the assault  but were given an alibi of a training accident  I regret to this day not telling her  so that maybe she would understand  She told me she would always love me and I said the same  and that was the last time I have seen her  that was   months ago  since then I had started to begin hanging out with friends and making amends to damaged ties  I found that I was yet again blocked from all forms of contact  All I wanted to do was tell her I was sorry and explain why I had been so estranged  I didnt want a second chance or to be in her life again I just wanted to apologize  I learned recently that she had moved in with a boyfriend she had been dating for   months and had ghosted most of her friends and her family  I finally had to go to her mother to get her to contact me  at which point I had basically plummeted in regards to my mental state  throughout this whole process of making repairs I had been fighting with all the mistakes and failures I had made and it has destroyed me entirely  When i Finally contacted her nearly a week and a half ago I told her what had actually happened at RTC  and that I was sorry  and had asked her for some information to put in my will and testament  The conversation was brief  and no more than a minute  but she had one of her friends ask her about me  and she told them about the will thing   not the assault  and that she was  calling my bluff  and was probably just  guilt tripping  her  I OD d on  k mg of ibuprofen  trying to induce acute kidney failure  less than    hours later  My family found me and rushed me to a hospital and they managed to save me  they have attempted to get me into therapy and such ever since  but the issue with that is I wont talk to them  since I just have the mentality that if i cant fix it myself no one can    amp  x   B   The true problems lie in what follows  A lot of her friends and some of her family have given up on her  but I have not  if she needed help I would leave everything I have in an instant to do whatever I could  Every time I pass her house or a car like hers my heart hits the floor  and I dont mean figuratively  I mean I have real  physical pain  I have nightmares about her getting hurt and I wake up puking  She still has refused contact with me and am unsure if she knows about the attempt  I dont want to bother or hurt her in any way  I kid you not that if she is happy with someone else then id rather it be that way to the end of time than spend one unhappy day with me  Something in me just cant leave her  numerous girls have started talking to me but I have refused all of them in some act of self sabotage  My question for you guys and gals is what do i do    I wont talk to friends or family  she wont talk to me  and I wont seek counseling  I just feel like im in a corner and out of ideas  and am afraid that if I get any worse I might eat a bullet  Thanks reddit  im sorry if I violate any rules but ive never done anything like this before and am just scared 
518,0,Classmate and i were constantly talking to eachother everyday through almost only texts but then stopped  After   months of radio silence she texted me again I    M  and her    F  used to talk to eachother everyday after school but almost never in school  It came to a point where we didnt really text eachother anymore  I think this was because I told her I liked her  Anyway after winter break was over we stopped talking at all during school or after  It comes to a point where I was ignoring her to try and get over the crush I have  It didnt work and at some point I was forced to talk to her and slowly I started talking to her a bit more during school    days ago she sent me a message out of nowhere  We texted for a bit and then the next day the same thing happened  Yesterday it didnt so today I texted her instead to try and show her I still am kinda interested in talking to her  The problem with this is that I know she most likely likes someone else and that is just messing with my head because she probably knows that I still like her yet texted me  After that text we started talking a bit more in school but she gives me no  i like you vibes   There is also the issue that when she talks to some other boy or vice versa and I see that she might like them more than me or something like that I get frustrated  Do you think I should text her or talk to her  Should I just try and get over her  What should my thought process be so i stop obsessing over most interactions

520,0,What is the best way to approach finding some pictures that are very suggestive of an affair My husband is out of town with a group of people  working on developing a podcast  His old phone is apparently linked with his current one because I just came across a bunch of pics and videos of him with one of the women there  incredibly beautiful  married  that she sent him  I am physically sick to my stomach  There is no  hardcore  evidence of adultery but the looks and smiles and little inside jokes lead me to believe there is something more  Multiple pics of them  close like they were superglued together  Videos of them alone on hikes  I am between tears and rage and anxiety right now  But I don t know the best approach  Since there s nothing solid I have of their actions all I have is some videos and pics that  could  be argued as platonic   I am picking him up from the airport in a few hours  Should I mention the photos and videos and tell him to stay at his moms tonight  Should I play it cool and see what his excuse is  Should I say anything at all and wait to see what other messages he gets and if I can get something solid  We have a child together and I don t want to jump to conclusions  but also  idk  it s not much of a jump based on what I saw  Advice    Thanks Redditors

523,0,I    M  dated this girl    F  and think I got rejected  Was it a rejection and what is best for me to do now We ve been texting for roughly   months now  that being every single day  and met twice  We had a good time both times  walking around for hours just talking and having dinner  Now  before meeting her the first time  I had to agree to just meeting as freinds initially and seeing where things would go since she said she wasn t ready for the next thing yet because her last relationship s been shit and wasn t very long ago  She also said she would let me know if she at some point thinks we won t be more than friends   which I found quite nice of her  We met on a dating app  by the way  Back on topic  two or three days after we met the second time  she told me that she doesn t think we ll ever be more than friends  I for my part really like her of course  so I was pretty sad hearing that  In my mind  it s a very clear rejection  But there is a  but   She s been texting me every single day since she told me that regardless   I expected her to not message me often anymore   and even asked to meet up again  So we ll meet up again soon  Now  should I just see how things end up and rely on that little hope  Should I stay away and sort out my feelings  Being with someone you like but know it won t ever be can be quite hurtful  Am I creating hope out of nothing  I m confused

525,0,    m  my     f  girlfriend is obsessed that I want to date somebody younger  I don t Title says a lot of it  My girlfriend and I have been together for a little over   months now but things went from casual to spending full weekends together rather fast  I don t mind it at all as I like to fully invest in a relationship once it begins    My GF has lately been very hung up on the fact that she is  positive  that I am going to leave her for a  younger  hotter    year old  and that its      what I want  Despite many numerous and crystal clear reassurances that not only is that not going to happen  but its also nothing I would be interested in anyway  she refuses to think she may be wrong  She things I am just lying to myself about how I feel    It keeps coming up  almost every other day or night we spend with each other  She can be very insecure about her appearance and age  thinks the world fundamentally and factually changes the minute you turn    as a woman  and I am trying to be as supportive as possible  but when you are thrown facts that       of men want to date a hot    year old there are only so many times you can explain what she believes is not the truth

527,0,I  M    cannot shake this girl  F    from my life and she won t give up I need another voice in my head besides my own because I can t trust it  A lot of details will be left out and made short  I just need some help    I met this girl last August and we clicked  Couldn t get enough of one another  Cliche start but whatever  Spent a lot of time smokin  lovin  and fuckin the first   months  She was awesome and we were unstoppable together  Everyone pointed us out and we were the light in a dead party  literally the only ones dancing and enjoying ourselves while others  with their SOs  didn t join in    Found out she saw her ex with family before he deployed while I was out of town visiting friends  She told me they were saying their good byes and that they aren t together anymore  but her grandparents loved him so much they wanted to see him before leaving  Whatever I dropped it  Kept my head up  That was November    January I found out she was talking to him SO MUCH since he left  Video chats  special names  and saying I love you and can t wait to get married  Blah all this ridiculousness  I knew about it but I wanted to be for sure before I confronted  So I asked her to show me some messages and she did  Saw what I needed to and told her I don t want to see her again and asked her to leave  I called her a liar  she took me for a joke and played me so yeah I told her to fuck off   I was so harsh because I gave this girl everything  Home  love  adventures  food  everything  Most things I don t have myself and she was never fortunate enough to have it   anyways besides these things she s been extremely secretive and controlling and emotionally abusive towards me and herself to a point where I am too now and I feel horrible about it because it reflects    These lasts two months have been ridiculous  She calls and texts daily and tries to talk to me like we expect to pick up where we left off  I had to block her for two weeks and she still wants to prove her love for me  She hates herself for emotionally cheating and she chronically depressed and sad  I used to always comfort her and reassure her but I don t anymore  I ve tried seeing her a few times and spending a simple day talking and seeing her but it doesn t make me feel any different  I was genuinely in love with this girl  I m really not trying to be dramatic about it  but she WAS my dream girl  Face  eyes  smile  voice    every single detail  Not anymore  She still says  I love you  but I can t say it back  And I try not to see her so often because I feel so much emotional distress between the two of us and abuse at this point  There s too much paranoia and anxiety  It s really hurting me now  I really want her to be better  She loves me unconditionally and will never give up  as she says  while I am stuck on the fence and don t know what I believe in anymore  Not myself  There s days where I won t speak to her and just try to have a normal day and ignore the fact that she exists because I truly want to move on and be alone  I want to be somewhat okay  not happy  just not so fucking sad all the time man  My mind spins all day long and I ve though about my situation on psychological degrees  simple versions  long term  I think too much  On the other days I miss the hell out of her and her lips and he human existence in my life but I don t trust her anymore  It s hard to say I love you and mean it  I compliment her because she will have a radiant frown on her face with her head down and I ll try to pick her head up and say something like   Hey dollface  where s your smile      never mind I m fucking rambling now  My heart hurts  My head hurts  Everything hurts so much and every day is a new    hours of unavoidable internal discomfort and pain  I don t know what to do anymore  I am so lost  
528,0,Herpes and the famous last words   I need space I    F  have been dating my boyfriend    M  for about   months now  We are currently doing the whole LDR deal  about     hours apart  so we really only see each other on weekends  We re both at the point in our lives where we want to settle down  And up till this point I thought everything was going smoothly  We were planning trips to meet each other s families    About   weeks ago I went for a routine checkup and asked the PA  to  test me for everything   She rattled off the list but did not include herpes  I basically said  and herpes   and she basically told me that they don t test for it unless you are presenting symptoms  I ve never had any symptoms  but would if I wanted to    Well  Low and behold  I m positive for HSV    I ve only been in a relationship  slept with   other people and got tested after each  surprise  not for herpes apparently   So I m positive but asymptomatic  I actually got a call from the head physician apologizing that they testing because all it does is cause  unnecessary trauma  and that it shouldn t be seen as a big deal  I took a few days to process and then told my boyfriend  He was nothing but supportive and understanding  and said we d get through it    We talked about it a lot and I truly felt okay about it  Honestly I feel like the stigma of HSV is terrible and that it s just another part of life  most people are exposed to it at some point       Well yesterday he called me and broke down  his blood test is today   He basically told me it s been bothering him more than he s let on and he just  needs space   We text and talk on the phone everyday but     of the phone calls are initiated by him  he s got a busy schedule  and texts are mutual     He said he doesn t want to break up but canceled our plans this weekend  then said oh well maybe we ll still go   He even said he still wants to meet my family in April  He just needs time to process everything and doesn t want to take out his negative feelings on me   Like I m not having a hard time with this too   We talked through it and he basically said he will still text and I can call if I need to talk or need anything    Thing is  I haven t heard from him since  I figured I d just let him process tonight and he d probably text me in the morning  Nope  Nothing    not even our normal call on our way to work  I understand that and I m ok with this space if this is what he wants   but   Should I text him  Obviously today was a hard day   and will be till he gets results  and I want him to know that I m here for him if he needs it    Is that stupid  Or seem clingy or needy  I just don t want him to think I don t care  
529,0,Me    M  and my gf    F  just can t break up properlyIt s difficult  I m together with her for   years now  our both first relationship  and things seem to get really worse every day  Especially for me  Because I m the one who want to break up actually  Mostly because I can t imagine a future with her and tbh I think I don t love her anymore  We don t really have anything in common too  I often find myself just waiting until it s finally time to go home when I m with her  Also  I pretty much suffer from depression  ADHD  and social anxiety as well  and I feel like I can t handle a relationship right now  The problem is  she suffers from mental health issues too  anxiety  eating disorder  and so on I feel unbelievable bad about breaking up with her  Leaving her when she needs me the most  since she s actually struggling with college and is on the edge to drop out  and I feel like she WILL most certainly fail when I break up with her   She is aware of how I feel about our relationship  but don t want it to be real and so on she tries to let me feel guilty about it  Reminding me of good times we had together  how much I had loved her etc    To be honest  sometimes I m also not doing it the right way   I think due to my depression  I often feel numb and don t really give a shit about her  I always saying things like  it s fine  and  I really like you and want to support you  even though I don t feel like doing this  Just that she doesn t feel so bad    So basicallly  I don t have an idea on how to break up with her the  correct  or the  most easy  way  I really can t do it anymore  and the wrong promises I make to her makes it just worse  I hate hurting people    I m thankful for any advices  
530,0,Would being overly obsessed  clingy and dependant cause issues later in a relationship I ve been dating the woman of my dreams for several years now  We fight and argue from time to time  have disagreements and sometimes act insensitively to each other  but nothing I would consider an issue or above average for a couple  I am completely satisfied and love her  but I ve been called out a few times by friends  co workers and others that we are very dependant on each other  When we are at work we stay in touch through text on an hourly basis  at home we are always in the same room  We shower together  and if at all possible go literally anywhere the other goes  Neither of us get any free space from the other  but neither of us have wanted it  We didn t start out like this either  it just kinda happened over the course of a few years  Is this THAT abnormal  Is this a red flag for something  I m just wondering if this is healthy behavior for a relationship  even if it is totally balanced 
531,0,I think my girlfriend used to be a manPlease bear with me while I try to explain this  It s gonna be long because I m not sure how to get it all out in a way that makes sense  so I m going to try to work it out as I go    I feel like a piece of shit for even thinking this or posting about it  but I can t get it out of my head  And it s not that I m anti trans or anything  but it s just a mind fuck that I thought I knew this person and she could have hidden an enormous part of herself and her past from me      And tbh I don t think I would have given her a chance had I known that about her  I guess I m not secure enough in my own masculinity or whatever  and I know that is probably exactly why she didn t tell me    but still  I feel like it s something I deserve to know  It s also something maybe she deserves to hide  I just keep going back and forth with how I feel   My reasons for thinking this have been slowly collected over the last   years we ve been together  Firstly  it s weird to say this  but her vagina doesn t really self lubricate  For a long time she would whip out the lube immediately and never let me penetrate without  No matter what I do  it doesn t get any wetter  I originally attributed it to a multitude of other reasonable explanations ranging from my own performance to a medical condition  But then I started picking up other clues   We don t live together  but we spend a lot of time at one another s places  Often days at a time  I started noticing that sometimes she d be wearing a patch  and she said it was one for smoking  She doesn t smoke  but she said it helped her with energy levels  I thought it was pretty weird and probably not good for her  but when I tried to discuss it with her she got really defensive and started a fight about how I always think I know what s best  So I left that alone    I didn t really think into it too much until later on  either  Some other red flags that something was off include that she wouldn t introduce me to any family or speak with them when I was around  claiming they are busy and not really involved in her life like that    she seems to have no friends or even acquaintances from before she moved to the state we both live in  and she has lots of doctor visits that she will not go into any detail about    Tbh  at first I was wondering if she was dying and that s what she s been hiding at the doctor visits     But then  one day she left Facebook up and logged in on her laptop when she got called into work  and it was on her friend requests  I saw that she had rejected several of them  and when I clicked on them  they all lived in the state she used to live in  I thought it was odd  but my first thought was actually that maybe she just wanted a clean slate for whatever reason  It made me more curious about her past though  as she d given kind of a generic backstory about herself and it all seemed pretty standard  She d never mentioned moving here to start over  and she has never confided in me about going through any huge trauma or big challenge    So this is when I started doing some things I m not proud of  I just sort of got this feeling of doom all at once and it consumed me  I needed to know more about her  and anytime I had ever probed in the past it had been met with hostility that I didn t really understand  She said she just doesn t like talking about herself and wants to live in the  now   I thought it was more of a quirk than anything else   I Googled her name and only got her current social media profiles    Not that odd  But then I spiraled downhill and got desperate and paid for a background check  There is literally nothing to indicate she existed until shortly before we met  This made me panic  circling in my mind about what could explain all this    I wondered about if she was a con artist or possibly a wanted criminal in hiding    How could there be no record of a person that wasn t using an alias or something   I thought answers had to be somewhere in her apartment  so I started looking any place that could potentially hide something where no one would think to look  I was even looking in the nooks and crannies of her freezer  Finally I stumbled on the little bag she had told me was  female stuff  like her tampons and birth control  Obviously I never had any reason or desire to open it before  I opened it up and it had no feminine products at all  and I thought it really was her birth control that was in there at first  but I Googled the namebrand on a whim  Aldactone  My heart dropped when I saw that it was a drug that is taken to block male hormones  I looked up if a woman who is born a woman would ever have any medical condition that would require the use of that as treatment  and it seems highly unlikely    I also saw while I was researching that there are estrogen patches that are used for men that transition into women as well    And it instantly made me think of the  smoking  patch my girlfriend wears   I also suddenly remembered this ID I found when she sent me to look for the bottle opener in her kitchen when we first started dating  I wasn t familiar with where things were yet  so I was opening all the drawers  One of them was kind of a junk drawer of sorts  and had this guy s ID in the back  I picked it up and looked at it  thinking maybe she was still seeing an ex or something  But it looked so much like my girlfriend  I decided it had to be her brother    But it wasn t her last name  I mentioned it when I came back out and she acted a little weird  about it but said yes  it s her brother s  but that they have different dad s  And that was that    When I remembered that  I went to see if it was still in the drawer by any chance  and it wasn t  So I did a Google search on him  and nothing came up  Then I did some searches on the names I d been given for her other siblings and parents and there was no evidence to support that they are a family that exists anywhere   I think she used to be a man  Why else would she have this medication  What else could explain all this other weird stuff and secrecy    I m not sure what to do at this point  I think the only conclusion to be drawn here is that she was born a male  but I m open to hearing other options     I think confronting her on this simply cannot go well and I don t think she would even tell me after she s been keeping up appearances like this for   whole years  At this point the lying is more bothersome than her past as a man    I ve been with her for a long enough to be able to look past that in time  I ve always seen her as a beautiful woman  and that s what she is no matter what she was born as    I just don t know if I can deal with the fact that she has been okay hiding this for   whole years  with no indication of planning to ever tell me  I want kids and she knows that  What was she planning to do if I wanted to try for a baby someday  Was she going to invent more lies to explain why she can t get pregnant  Was she never planning to stay with me at all   I don t know what to think anymore  Or how to feel  Or what to do  
532,0,My   m  live in fuck buddy   f   whom i work with  doesnt know I m in love with my other coworker   f   who is now pregnant   For the last month I ve had a live in fuck buddy from work  We messed around one night after I went to work and was boasting about another online sex date I had just left from  I got her number in front of another co worker I was in love with at the time but didn t know the feelings we re returned   So this girl hasn t left my place for a month  In the last week things have gotten serious with the other coworker  We professed our love for each other like   days ago and then the next day at work she frantically announced she was pregnant with her boyfriend s child  I have talked to her and she doesn t want me to back off  So things are continuing to progress  Meanwhile she is looking for a place with HER boyfriend and I have my  GF  living with me   I don t know what to do  She won t have an abortion  idk if I want to be a dad anymore  I just wanna bang and it seems like she s down  and my live in knows nothing and is a good woman but it was never supposed to be anything other than a fuck here and there so I don t feel bad       Help 
533,0,I feel so stupid and ignorantThere s this guy I met four months ago who I fell madly for  He reallly liked me at first and then he pushed me away and said he only wanted to be friends  But he would continue to hit me up just for casual sex  and I always agreed because I have a hard time letting go  But I also really liked him  Last night I met who I thought was just his best friend  who is a female  and she told me that him and her hook up and that he fell in love with her best friend  But her best friend rejected him  and that s why he pushed me away  Because he had met her  and decided he didn t want me anymore  I didn t know any of this  I only knew that he hung out with this girl often but he always insisted they were just friends  We were never in a relationship or anything  but he always insisted it was just me that he was hooking up with  The only reason I ended up meeting her was because the other night he was ignoring me and I kind of freaked out and kept calling him until he blocked me  And then she called me trying to reassure me that nothing was happening between them   And I asked her if she would meet up with me the next day so I could ask her some stuff because he never talks to me about anything  And she agreed and then I found all this out and now I feel so heartbroken and stupid for believing I was the only one in his life  Even though he made it clear he never wanted a future with me and he didn t like me that way  but he only wanted me for sex  I still have this false hope that maybe he did have feelings for me because of the way he would just hold me or how if I told him I didn t wanna see him anymore he would immediately come crawling back  But now I know that he was doing the same thing with her the whole time  She said that they often get drunk and hook up and cuddle together all the time but she says it means nothing and that she used to have strong feelings for him but now she accepts that he will only ever be her friend  I don t think anyone will read this nor care about my situation but it really helps me to just get it all off my chest  I haven t stop crying today  I feel so dumb for sticking around this whole time thinking I had a chance  And the worst part is I still hope he ll try and talk to me and hit me up  and I don t know if I ll be strong enough to ignore him or not  
534,0,Baby mama drama My boyfriends baby mama is the absolute worst  We ve only ever spoken twice and seen each other in person once    She continues to bad mouth me  calling me a piece of shit  a whore  I m trashy so on so forth  She has no idea who I am  This is all based on my social media and her perception of me  I ve never had the chance to defend myself and I don t think I ever will   Now she wants to meet me  since I m going to be in their son s life     How would you keep your cool  Because I m so angry  I don t know how to go about this situation  in fact I don t want to meet her because I know I ll go off on her and she s incredibly toxic    There is a lot more to this story of her but really I just need advice on how to handle meeting her if I ever do  
535,0,I    M  feel like am setting with my fianc e    F  but at the same time I think I can do betterTL DR I m setting but I really doubt I can do better so I don t know what I should do   TITLE ERROR IT SHOULD READ I DON T THINK I CAN DO BETTER  I m    and ever since I was    have been trying hard to get a girlfriend but failed miserably  I m talking advanced incel levels of faliure  Such as going to   speed dating events with no matches  Maxing out tinder and other apps with no dates or even proper matches  Failed day game  everything  To top it off I m     and recently I posted pictures of me online to be rated by women and the results came back as         Possible explanations are having aspgers syndrome  being ugly in real life or being Egyptian in the UK where there are also no other members of my race   Anyway being desperate I d always ask for arranged marriages and my parents would bring back obese women that I d reject outright  Untill about   months ago where my mum brought back my current fianc e   She is an ex incel too   At first I thought she was super hot  sometimes I still do  and I was all over her  Then our relationship turned super disfunctional and in a bad attempt at trying to be honest I told her she wasn t hot enough  too fat and that the reason I loved her to begin with was that I thought she was a nurse and the awnser to my prayers   Somehow she was still desperate to marry me and lost   kg  started a job as a nursing assistant so she could train as a nurse and just tried to look better  She is very loving and just clings to me non stop and just does whatever I tell her and agrees to anything  She agreed to let me have other women if I find them  to not do a legally binding wedding and to get hiv testing  Her only rule was  don t ever devorce me  and I think she picked up on the fact that I m sort of considering it even though I denied it multiple times  I insisted on non legal marriage and legal disclaimer and am calling lawyers now to make sure I don t get stuck with her   Despite all this I still feel like I m settling because I really want to marry a top tire model looking woman and she is just average basically  Logically my brain says marry her because a I don t have other options and b she will let me have side girls anyway so I m not missing that much by marrying her  But inside I feel like neither of us really wants to be there but we re there because it s better than being lonely for life  We re always going out together and love spending time with eachother and often we have a really great time together but something feels deeply wrong but then again so does my life in general   My therapist said I should marry her because she s hot and that I m just having intrusive thoughts that should be ignored  I m considering leaving her for a while and hiring out high grade hookers every week but I doubt I will go through with it due to relgion   Although maybe I should if that s the only way I can sleep with a model tier woman   Any thoughts  other than trolling or hating     To see pictures of me and her go on my profile   it says NSFW for some reason but it s safe   we are not that ugly as you d think from this story 
536,0,My  M    girlfriend  F    is too baby crazy  and it s starting to wear on meMy gf has PCOS  she wants a kid so badly too  but recently most of her friends are pregnant or just had a kid and that s really starting to affect her  I m away for school until September the earliest  and cant always be with her  not gonna lie I ve been a bit of a dick to her from stress  money issues and what not  i wouldn t even have been surprised if she left me it was that bad  but i started to improve my attitude  started a job in the field im in school for  and thought things were getting better  about a month ago she stopped taking birth control which she was mainly taking for the pcos  shes also stopped taking some of her meds  which we both agree she needs to go back on  Most of her friends are getting pregnant and she s feeling let out and saying that its all she s ever wanted  Im not ready for a kid and ive tried reasoning with her but she wont listen to me nor our mutual friend  Almost every other fight is about her wanting a baby now  Im getting tired about and its not even a guarantee that shell even get pregnant even on ivf  Prior to her friends getting pregnant we agreed to try in a year or so  when we have an apartment together and money saved up  I dont want to break up with her  weve been dating for   years and known each other for     years now  Shes my best friend and the one i love most  but how do you know when enough is enough 
537,0,My    F  partner s    M  mother doesn t like me and I want to know how to move past this  Hey guys  i need advice please x  My    F  partner    M  and I used to fight a lot  We have been doing so much better now  and can talk to each other with empathy and compassion  When we used to fight a lot  he used to turn to his mum for advice  who I have to note  is a textbook narcissist  My partner has always been off with his mum because of her narcissism  but when we were fighting heaps  he would turn to her and she would give him advice  Because of this era  his mum is now indifferent to me  has spoken badly about me in the past and its made me feel very uncomfortable and estranged uninvolved with his life  My boyfriend lives with her at the moment  I have my own one bedroom apartment  and she s helping him find his own place  We used to live together but don t want to live together again until we know for sure we re solid and have a great foundation   His mums going to inspections with him  and helping him clean up the new apartment etc  and I made a comment how I feel uninvolved  because I cant really come along with his mum and him  If this were the other way around  my partner would feel the same way  he has a big thing on feeling involved in my life  His mum in the past has made comments like  if she brings anyone around here  I know bikies    mind you that s absolutely insane and I never would have done that  Im not malicious at all  But when my partner and I were on the rocks  she was ruthless towards me  said nasty things about me to my partner  never to my face though  And I ve always been nice to her  but I guess what my boyfriend was saying allowed her to talk that way  She once made a comment about feeling intimidated by me  when I ve never done anything but small talky  general talk stuff with her  never had confrontations or anything  maybe that has something to do with it  When we fought  it was communication breakdowns  always  never anything bad like infidelities etc  we just never knew how to communicate our issues  Anyway  fast forward to now  his mum said I will clean the new apartment for you but you have to come over to clean your  nd car  which she is selling for him  I made a comment that I hate that I feel uncomfortable to come over to your family house  And my partner said that he s talked with his mum about having to accept me and respect me when I m around   He now says its up to me to make the next move to come over with him to wash his car with him  and he s doing all that he can to rectify this  He asks me if there is anything he can do to make this better for me  He doesn t go to his mum about our problems anymore  because he s since realized  her advice isn t actually great advice  she just goes on a bitching tirade  My partner has since pulled his relationship back with her   when he s his self the most  he cant stand her  but when we were fighting they were really close   He cant stand her narcissist ways when he s most himself  And when she gets a thought in her head  its hard to reverse it  she s a stubborn lady  He now has gone back to a superficial relationship  the way it used to be  If anyone has a narcissist in their family  you understand it s the best course of action   So my question is  I don t really know what to do  I m conflicted at the moment because I want to be more involved with his life  but I feel so uncomfortable around his mum after all the horrible things she s said about me to him  What would you do in my position  He is of the mindset that if I don t go  well then he s done all he can to include me  so I feel obligated to go  but I just feel so uncomfortable  knowing all the horrible things she said about me  I ve had   serious relationships and ive never experienced a partners parent not liking me before and its hard for me because ive always been family oriented like that  I like bringing baked goods over  Sunday drinks etc  and this feels like im missing out on that but I don t know how to get around the comments and awful things she said  What would you do in my situation   Another reason I ve got an issue with all of this is before me   his ex was very involved with all his friends  and dad and mum  but he says he was growing estranged from all of them before he met me  But in my overreactive brain  it just looks like he doesnt want to involve me  I want to believe him  and I guess i need to get it in my head that its not about me  as he says   I shook up his  mundane  world when I met him  and have shown him a very alternative exciting lifestyle  I m a straight forward no bullshit type girl  and people get that essence from me  which i think is the reason his mum has felt intimidated by me  His last ex was a very passive  dependent  beta type  and I m the polar opposite  He says since meeting me   its made him reevaluate his friends and everything else in life  He doesn t find his friends interesting anymore  as its conversations of  ohh hows work  etc etc  Office banter  So its all just a fucky timeline tbh  and I m trying to take it as not personal  and that he has just changed with what he wants inn life from everything including relationships  which he has  he s a completely different person now from when I met him  Sorry I m rambling at this point  i just wanted to add a bit more onto this   TLDR  I have a bad relationship with my partners mum  and i dont know what to do to move past it   Edit  I want to add that my partner has made the comment of this being the perfect opportunity for me to be involved and i have to take it 
538,0,Guy M    I ve  F    been seeing for about a month declined going down on me That s pretty much the gist of it  We ve been sleeping together for a little over a month and I ve given him head almost every time we ve slept together and never ask for reciprocation because I honestly don t like it THAT much  However  the other night I was drunk and asked him to and he said no that he didn t do that and I m not sure how I feel about that  Even tho I m not crazy about it I d at least like the option when I do want it  He also does not last very long  about   minutes or less  and that was already bugging me    Idk    would it make me an asshole for ending things because of that  
539,0,My    f  friend    f  is really struggling and I m at a loss of what to do My    f  friend    f  is having such a hard time these days  Things are not going well in her marriage  her brother recently diagnosed with a life threatening illness  and she doesn t get a lot of support from her family or in laws  She has   children under the age of    I know she is having a hard time so I invited her on a vacation to my family s vacation home for spring break  Things did not go well  Her kids were a disaster  Every meal and bedtime ended with my friend in tears  I offered to look after her kids for a bit so she could go out for a meal and have some alone time  She declined  This morning we discussed what we should do for the day  I mentioned there were leftovers for lunch and had made an off the cuff comment to the kids about behaving at a restaurant  She took it the wrong way and accused me of being embarrassed to eat with her kids at a restaurant  I said I didn t mean it that way but she got really upset  She packed her things and left  We have eaten many times at restaurants with our kids  sometimes they  my kids and her kids  are good  sometimes not    it s never been an issue and we typically hang out once a week  I texted my friend to see if she made it home ok  she didn t answer    I know this isn t about me or even about what happened this morning and my friend is just having a hard time but I feel really sad  I don t really know how to continue supporting her and I don t want to turn into the bad guy or accidentally say the wrong thing  Where do I go from here 
540,0,She s    F  flying off and I feel really down and lost    M  Any advice Met a Korean exchange student for a week and spent a lot of time with her visiting places  talking  sharing about ourselves   I m from an Asian country btw  However  i knew I had limited time with her so I decided to treat it as if we re friends hanging out and did not say anything to her  But safe to say  I caught the feels    I Guess it s because for the first time  I actually shared many common interest passion and career focused goals as someone and I found it easy to just be myself around her  She was unlike all the other dates I ve had locally  I was honestly giving up hope on finding someone that I truly enjoyed sharing my Everyday experiences with  It s a good reaffirmation I Guess  because I now know what it means to date and figure out what you like and don t like in a person   We re final year medical students  and she tells me she really hopes to do her training in my country  her reason for coming here  to check the place out  but we both know that s it s a difficult process that may or may not happen  And if it does it s another   years at minimum    I can t think straight  But one thing I know for sure is that she s definitely unlike the other girls I ve dated and is someone I find myself compatible with which is why I m feeling excited and the way I m feeling right now  I ll definitely be visiting her in the future where she ll be showing me around but even that I can t confirm the date due to our schedules   I ve said my goodbyes to her and sadly won t be able to send her off  I m not sure what s the best thing I should do now  moving forward  To keep in contact or   any advice         
541,0,Can my ex    F  and I    M  figure this out Hey reddit  I    M  could really use some advice on my situation with my ex       We had been together for a year and a few months and we just broke up the other day  The last month or so had been very rough for us  We had been fighting a lot and we didn t see eye to eye on some things in our relationship  Our  honeymoon phase  ended and the sight of each other triggered instant annoyance and resentment  My ex had said that we didn t really know each other  and she had been encouraging me to open up more and be communicative  That was difficult for me  since I ve never really been an open person  It was killing our relationship however bc she said we didn t know much about each other  and that the basis of our relationship was sex and Netflix and chilling  We decided to take a break  basically break up  and to really think and do some soul searching to find out if we are truly compatible   I can t help but feel sad of course  but another part of me feels relived  free almost  We were fighting all the time bc of my frustrations on the decrease of sex and intimacy  She said she was trying to build a  foundation  and an actual  base of friendship  and that may frustration with the decrease in sex had shown my true colors  We weren t where we needed to be as a couple in her opinion  and we wouldn t get there unless we took the next step    Right now  my plan is to go no contact for a month  I want to see if I ll still miss her then or if staying single is what s best for me now  On the other hand however  I feel like our problems can be fixable if we both get on the same page and maybe we both just need some time away from each other  Relationships take work  especially after the honeymoon phase ends   We had some great times together  and I do love her  Anybody been in a similar situation  Any advice would be appreciated

545,0,I     m started dating someone and fell in love  Feel like I can t keep it casual Hello everyone    amp  x   B   sorry in advance for the long post  The core of this is quite simple and has been happening since people started boning  But this just increases the likelyhood of good advice I guess   I care enough about this one to make a post here and look for advice    amp  x   B   Having always been in longer relationships since I was around     I got out of the last one around    and have been more or less single for the last   years  During this time  I have learnt to be really comfortable with  and by  myself  So much so  that I wanted to be nothing but single  to have more time for myself and my music  Everytime I got closer to someone  I had to break it off after only a few weeks at most  even if the other person was just looking for something easy going  this would be too much for me  I would get this feeling of being  responsible   Do I text or not  She wants to hang out but I don t   should I do it anyway because I feell obliged  To get it out of the way    There would always be this kind of pressure in my head  that would lead me to break it off   followed by a huge relief  Some of the girls were quite heartbroken  but I had to tell them I couldn t commit to someone in any way or form  Maybe I didn t care about them enough after all   which brings me to the next part   A few months ago  I got a text from a random number  It was from a girl who I had met a couple years ago  We had only met a handful of times during these years  but there was always something in the air and the eyes  oh those eyes  between us and she defintely had some small dark corner of my brain reserved  if that makes sense    I agreed to that first date  even though these past experiences started popping up in my head  But why not  We started dating and hit it off fairly quickly  We are really comfortable around each other and it s just actually nice spending time together  It feels like we have been closer for a long time  even though acutally we barely know each other  This goes both ways   I think about nothing  noone and nowhere else when I m with her  Sex is great  so are our conversations  Spending whole days in bed  Going on dates  sometimes even with some of her friends  or some of mine  Everything looking good so far    amp  x   B   Maybe you know where this is going    amp  x   B   Turns out she just came out of a longer relationship    Reaching out to that person you ve been thinking about  after you get out of a relationship  Been there   Wanting something casual after a longer relationship  Understandable   Now once this came up  I told her how fine and cool I am by myself  That I feel complete at the moment and don t need another person to do that for me  We can take it at whatever pace she feels like  I don t want to pressure her  After all  the more space and quiet for myself  the better  right  I believed it the moment I said it  but oh boy   I fell in love with her after this  Like madly  Noticing all these little quirks and flaws and finding them oh so special and lovely  Butterflies and then sadness when we are not together  It feels quite silly   but it s the whole   yards  is that how you say it    It feels like the tables have turned  I am not in charge anymore  like all these past times  Now I don t want to be alone   I want to be with her  Looking at my phone constantly  hoping for a message  even though we both hate small talk and texting   only doing so to set up a date   The times inbetween our meetings feel like the time after a breakup beause of the silence  Actual sadness   Again  I feel quite silly   as this is not the confindent and relaxed self that I have  worked  on for so long  I suspect I do have an anxious attachment style after all   Obviously I will talk to her about it next time  I am quite a rational person  so my first instinct is to break it off  so as not to get deeper into it and be more hurt in the end  Then take the short term pain sadness and move on  Maybe we are both meeting at the  wrong  time in life  and that s OK    amp  x   B   But after all this time alone and not really experiencing a feeling of love  this feels to intense to pass up as well  We are all suckers for that I guess    amp  x   B   Then again   maybe it s just a phase and I should stick around for the ride  See where it takes me  just enjoy something for once and try to learn to be more easy going about being with someone for once   Maybe I m just panicking because I actually like someone for once and am scared of losing that    amp  x   B   Any advice or experience is appreciated  Maybe you notice something about my story or a pattern that I don t see  Maybe you were in a similar position  Is there something I can do or say     amp  x   B   Thanks for taking the time to read trough all this    amp  x   B   tl dr  met a girl and started dating  She wants something casual and I want something a little more serious  I only know it the other way around

551,0,My    f  ex fiance    m  is expecting me to pay late fees on his credit card thar we both owe money to  I m not sure how to respond a d don t feel that I m entirely in the wrong Fiance and I separated    months ago  Basically after   years together he realized he didn t want to spend his life having to worry about someone else  or having someone else worrying about him  It wasn t some big dramatic thing  No cheating that I m aware of  It remained pretty calm outside of him going through my boxes to take stuff he wanted but I paid for  I didnt want things to get mean so I wasn t worried about it  The choice was his and left me financially screwed for a while paying off wedding stuff for a wedding that never happened  The giant expensive wedding was mostly his idea  Original wedding would have cost around   k  He kept adding things and changing things that made it much more expensive  Wedding party went from a couple of close friends to    people  Guests went from    people to     people  Venue went from   k to   k  Overall turned into a    k wedding that I was paying for     of  Including having to take out a loan since I m not loaded   Bill s were split in that he paid for utilities and cellphones and I paid for the house  furniture  food  trips  pet costs  Most of his extra money went to hobbies  He had a savings account but never shared how much was in it  In order to afford furniture he got a credit card with a furniture store for   k  with the agreement that I would pay for furniture  I also bought guest room and living room furniture out right    Once we separated we divided furniture and he kept about half  We both took furniture I paid for outright and furniture that still needed to be paid for  We agreed i would pay half of the balance left and he would pay the other half  A couple weeks ago he messaged me saying I was late  I gave him some money and asked how much I owed  He said I owed the remainder of the balance  I reminded him we agreed I wouldnt pay the whole thing since he kept half the furniture  including things I d already paid for and picked out for myself  He agreed and said I would just owe      and he would pay the remainder    Like I said  money has been super tight since separating  My hours have been cut at work  I m paying for more  and still paying off a loan I got for a wedding he wanted  yes I know this was idiotic  I thought hey i love him and this is something he wants so I ll make it happen  Mistakes were made   He messaged me today saying there was a late fee on the card and he wanted me to pay that  I disagree that I should have to pay it since he owes on the card also and we never decided I would pay in a lump sum  I don t see why he couldn t have just made the payment  Or hell even messaged me when the payment was due  He s the one getting the bill in the mail   What are your thoughts  Should I have to pay this late fee for a bill he never even tells me is due  And was trying to get me to pay the entirety of after we agreed I wouldn t  Especially since I was the one paying for it over the course of our relationship and he kept furniture I bought outright

555,0,   f   my boyfriend has a twin with an illness  living with them I am coming to you  in hopes that you would be able to provide another side to this situation that I am unable to see for myself  Over the past few months I have felt as if my Boyfriend is stuck choosing between me or his brother  I am in no way telling him to choose me or trying to be selfish by taking away the needs of his brother  but this situation is unlike any I ve been in yet  I have been with my boyfriend for a little over   years in November  I always knew he had a twin brother who is bi polar schitzaphorenic  My boyfriend and his twin brother live together  and from their backstory my boyfriend has always been his brother s main form of dependence  I knew and agreed when I moved in to living with both of them  and working our way up to help his brother be dependent on his own again  however after a year and a half of living together nothing has changed  His brother  is currently living rent free  pays no bills  has a job but spends his money of fast food and luxuries for himself  and doesn t help out with household chores  My own opinion is that his disability has conjured into laziness because he knows my boyfriend will always be there for him  I am certain at this point he is taking advantage of my boyfriend  but my boyfriend doesn t want to hear this    My boyfriend shuts down whenever I try to bring up an idea I have to help his brother become financially dependent  such as him paying the internet or giving us money to help him save  I ve gotten to the point where I have placed a lock on the computer because he will sit there for hours end and watch YouTube  I love my boyfriend  and I don t see myself with anyone  but me trying to give us a better life  and wanting to start a future of our own together is fading as I feel like we will never be able to split from his brother  I am not down playing his illness at all  but as they are brothers and it s their house I moved into I feel as if i have become a third wheel in their relationship  I know that moving out would be the best solution for me  but I feel like it would be taking a giant step backwards in our relationship  one that I don t want to make  But ultimately I feel I have reached a cross roads of if I love this man  I accept him and his life for everything  or I need to move on  Each option makes me sick to think about  and I m beginning to let my anger show in a bad way to the both of them    I am not sure what to do  and maybe I m blind to my love  and that I need to move on   but I need some help    
556,0,Me    M  and Ex Girlfriend    F  are trying to fix things between us  This is how its been going and I really need some help in resolving this  This is the first time I ve posted on this sub and first time I ve spoken out about it So basically this girl and I  lets call her  Jesse   have been talking since early November of       We met on a school field trip to Epcot  We hung out and had a good time together  we started talking more and more and eventually I really caught feelings for this girl  But there was one thing I noticed  She was really close with this friend of hers that shes known for quite a while  we ll call him  James    Right off the bat this made me uncomfortable because she would go to his house after school with her best friend  lets call her Kate   but sometimes she would go by herself  I didn t know much about Jesse and James s relationship except for the fact that they were close friends  I then asked her and she told me that he s her best friend and I asked for a little bit more details and she said that they  tried things  for a week or so right after her last   year relationship  Not only did they try things  they engaged in light sexual activity  That immediately set off red flags but I ignored them  Her family soon got to know me and everyone loved me and I truly felt at home with them  Soon after that I found out that James really really really likes Jesse  and has been trying to get with her for a while   She took a while to make a decision but on January  st        she chose me    Things went okay for a while  she wasn t going over to his house as much but it was still happening every now and then and that bugged me a lot  I was scared of saying anything in fear of losing her so I kept it to myself for about a month until I really couldn t keep it in anymore and things got bad  we got into a fight  Fights happened for about   or   days consecutively until February  th when I broke up with her  I broke up with her because while her and Kate were at James s house  Kate told me that they were basically cuddling on the couch watching a movie  completely excluding Kate which is something they normally do  This infuriated me as that is considered cheating in my book  As well as her emotional attachment to him which included saying  I love you  and an uncomfortable amount of physical interaction  I believe the definition of cheating to be  When one partner is channeling physical or emotional energy  time and attention into someone other than the person they are in a committed relationship with to the point that their partner feels neglected  which was without a doubt  what was happening   After this happened  I figured we were done and stopping initiating conversations  She kept initiating them and I kept responding until eventually she asked to come over to talk  I felt bad for her because this was effecting her a lot so I allowed it and we talked for a bit  I figured another fight would break out and it did  But after things settled down  she got really empathetic and kept telling me that she understood and would try and  work on it   Me being the absolute idiot I am believed her  Things went back to normal  we were still kissing and she was coming over after school and we were pretty much friends with benefits at that point  But I assured her that there would be absolutely no fucking around with anyone else  She agreed and we continued    Some time went by of the same thing and we were starting to hang out less and less but still quite a bit plus shes moving soon and has been busy packing and helping her family and stuff which is understandable  One day we decided to see a school play that one of her friends is in  She told me between classes that the plan was to go to James s  by herself  after school and then have me pick her up from his house to go see that play  I told her that I wasn t okay with that and that I really didn t want her to go  I told her that it made me feel an unbelievable amount of anxiety and discomfort to the point where I could barely even function when she was there because that was all I could think about  She got pissed and when I say pissed I mean blood boiling angry  I was not about to deal with that in the   minutes I had to get to my next class so I just walked away  She ended up going to his house anyway  Which really fucking hurt if im being honest  I ended up going to the play with her anyway  During the ride there she mentioned how she took off this bright red lipstick that she was wearing earlier  just for me   That really gave me a weird feeling but I didn t mention anything    The next day we were planning to hang out at my house for a little bit  She said that she would ask for permission and text me back  An hour later I text her again and asked her whats happening  She responded and told me that she was going to go to the mall with her cousin  I asked if she wanted to do something later and she said maybe  I just said okay  A few hours later on her cousins snapchat story  I saw Jesse and James in the back of a car jamming out to some music  I let her know how much that bothered me  She seemingly didn t give a single fuck and continued hanging out with him  ending up at his house  which I didn t know until the next day   She was sending me snaps of either just black or close up of her face that night saying she was at home with her dad ordering food  I then received a text from Kate telling me that shes     sure she recognized some stickers that were on the wall at James s house but I was only receiving close up snaps and she was receiving normal ones at the same time   A few hours later I received a snap from her showing me that she was in the car  I asked why and she told me that her dad left her house a little while ago to go to his girlfriends house and came back to get her  then took her to go pick up her older sister from her friends house  Which makes no sense because her older sister can drive and even if he did have to get her  I dont know why he would waste gas going back home just to go pick Jesse up  then to the friends house to get her sister  then back home  I figured it was all bullshit but I had no proof so I didn t say anything    So  not too long after this I managed to get her to come over and I had a conversation with her  I told her that I dont trust her enough to be okay with her going over there  I was sure to let her know that I wasn t attempting to control her but instead inform her that I m not going to stick around if this behavior continues  She asked me why and I explained that her behavior does not reflect that of someone who is in a relationship with someone or wants to be in a relationship with someone  She got really really pissed off  I told her once again how it makes me feel  I even tried to tell her that if she s going to continue to go over there anyway even if im not okay with it then to at least tell me  Her response was that I cant control her and i dont need to know where she is  She also mentioned how we aren t dating and she can  do whatever she wants   Sure enough she said she ll work on it and once again I believed it like an idiot   Couple days go by and I find out from someone else that shes at James s house again  At this point I was done  I straight up told her that things aren t changing  that shes not trying hard enough and that this clearly isn t going anywhere and that I was just done  She begged and sobbed and even tried to convince me that if I left then  her life wouldn t be worth living anymore    Obviously at this point I had no choice but to stay because she has had similar feelings in the past   Throughout this whole situation usually during every fight  she has told me that she had a panic attack or that shes having trouble breathing and I obviously had to end the conversation  This is why it was really hard to get anything through to her  I think that whenever the conversation or argument wasn t going her way  She d have a  panic attack  in order to get the conversation to stop   It is now March   th       I am still in the exact same situation and quite frankly  I need help or a way to get out of it or a way to fix it or something  I got into an argument with her today and as usual  She got pissed off  started yelling  had a  panic attack  and im kinda just over it at this point   TLDR  Girl that is  in love with me  and  wants a future with me  is continuously going to another guys house despite me practically begging her not to  completely neglecting the way I feel  So I told her that if she wants a future with me then she needs to stop and distance herself from him

561,0,How to read her behavior    f I m trying to keep this as short as possible but IDK how  I m kinda infatuated really like with a girl that I know from my church   I m praying to god she doesn t know what Reddit is    Anyway I can t tell if she likes me or not but we used to go back and forward and argue  insult each other  occasionally  Suddenly out of the blue she gave me her Kik and made me follow her page on Instagram but I deleted those two quite a while ago and I have no way to contact her    Flashback to two years ago and we ve go on a trip together to the downtown area and she shares her food with me and I do the same for her    Eventually during said trip she starts feeling me up etc  I m kinda of a jumpy person so she got a laugh out of that  A hour later and it s time to go  she randomly says she wants to give me a hug  I refuse at first then hug her then feel her up at the same time  her lower back and rear   I can t really remember what happened after that but she went silent and hasn t talked to me as much   Fast forward to yesterday and we get invited to have a party at an alternate location    We take the bus there and I sit across the seat from her where she greets me and I respond  hey    A few minutes later she puts her hand a few feet in front of my face  I look confused and she puts it away    We later arrive and head into a dark room with glow sticks  she comes along with a glow stick and waves it in front of my face  I do the same except that it s pretty close between her mouth and nose and she says something along the lines of  That s not the hole where that goes  or  You don t put it in that hole   I went dead silent  who wouldn t   I think I said  What   And she said  Suck my dick  and I responded something along the lines of either  No you  or  You first   She walks away  comes back again later then lifts her hand up again  I copy her and she gives me a high five before continuing to talk to her friend that rode with us   She plays around with her friend  they start running around the room  they start horse playing and she backed into me about once or twice but I nudged her off  I don t think she knew what she was doing   She occasionally stood by me from a distance  went back to partying and then talking to her friend   I then walked out the dark room to use the restroom  I come back out and head back into the entrance to the dark room and she suddenly walks out    She tells me to not go back in there and stay with her  I head back in there before she calls my name again and I turn around  before she takes a seat and tells me to sit by her    I sit by her as she ties her shoe and I turn away from her  She gets up  calls my name and tells me to follow her down the hall where she bends over a little bit and starts to take a sip from the water fountain  occasionally eyeing me before she tells me that she had got the taste of a glow stick stuck in her mouth which is why she went to the fountain   I ask her why and she responds that she likes putting things in her mouth  she says something else but I don t catch it  I tell her that only little kids do that  She tells me that she does whatever the hell that she wants to do   We walk back in the room with me behind her and she lifts up her jean jacket a small amount and I can see her lower back a little bit before she lets it back down when we get back into the room   Few minutes later it s time to go and not a word was said  we hop back on the bus and now she s sitting at the seat behind the one she was sitting at while she talks to her friend   Tl dr  I m kinda interested in this girl that I don t talk to much but I just can t read her actions  I feel like I brushed her off by calling her childish  Is there anyway I can send her semi obvious signs that I like her  how do I semi sexually flirt since she seems to be flirting with me  I only see her on Sundays and I m nervous about fucking this up 
562,0,I m    M  loosing my affection for my partner    F  of   years throwaway account    amp  x   B   We ve been together for bit over   years and we re living together for about two and half  There is no doubt in my mind she loves me and that she is happy  but lately I m not sure I feel the same   She is a great person  intelligent  kind  generally happy  We are compatible in many ways   have similar sense of humor  are able to use arguments and not get mad when either of us is proven wrong  mostly accept each others quirks  can be ourselves  read completely mad and weird  around each other    But we are also lacking in some   For one I lost physical attraction to her  She is passably attractive  but it s not doing it for me anymore  We are rarely having sex due to my lack of initiative as I m just not into her  I have no idea what changed   my attraction for her just faded   There is also the thing that I m not really feeling much for her  I like being with her  she is fun  but it s not like I d be mad if she decided to just be friends as that s more like what I m feeling towards her anyway   I also used to be much more impressed by her  she was handling her degree and full time job while often talking about various hobbies and I tried to encourage her to do whatever she set her mind on  but she seem to lack passion towards anything  which makes her  well ordinary   something she wasn t  at least in my eyes  before    amp  x   B   Now if I felt like this earlier  I d likely let her go  But we are getting older and we both want children  If I break up with her now I not only loose a close friend  at one point she told me she wouldn t be able to stay friends when we were watching some movie where people broke up and wanted to stay in touch  I might also cost her a chance to have family at reasonable age  I know she d be devastated  and technically homeless as we live in my apartment  She d probably have to spend some of her savings which she was hoping to use on wedding and or child stuff whichever came first to get an apartment  Even thinking about it feels horrible  I m not particularly attractive or charismatic  so there is very little chance I d actually find someone else who I d be more into  So we d probably both end up being miserable for a long time    amp  x   B   If we stay together  get married and have children   she ll be happy  I ll probably be whatever I m now and maybe I find my way back to feeling more for her again someday  And even if things stay the way there are I ll probably be better of than without her    amp  x   B   What do I do  Would it be unfair to her to just stay with her 
563,0,How do I approach pro plague  sorry   anti vax  family members regarding new baby So my husband    M  and I    F  are hopefully going to have our first child in August   After several losses and difficulties    I recently found out that several of my husband s cousins are completely unvaccinated    Fs and  M all in their   s   From what I ve been told  they all adamently refuse to ever get vaccinated   I love these people and have always enjoyed spending time with them  The family usually gets together as a big group about   times a year  though cousins have also been known to get together on our own  And for the past   years    lived with Grandma so we would see them frequently   With the return of measles  mumps and pertussis it s too dangerous to have an unvaccinated newborn around the known threat of unvaccinated adults   Babies get their MMR vaccine at    months    So this means that baby and I will be excluded from any family gatherings  including baby s first Christmas  for the first     months of his her life   Possibly    months until after the second dose    I was also recently asked for my input on baby shower guest list   Shower will be after baby is born   I will have to exclude the unvaccinated cousins  which is going to cause drama and hurt feelings  I will also have to exclude them from our  come see our new house  party this fall  I know these are their own fault  But it s so unfair that Husband and I  and the grandparents and great grandma  miss out on baby having a first Christmas with the family  baby won t remember or care    And Yes  I know it is a risk every time you take a baby out in public  But that is a potential risk from people I won t be allowing near my child  vs a known risk in a small crowded space   Anyway  I don t really know how to actually approach the issue without sounding like a crazy  demanding  unreasonable  self centered person   I can t just come out of nowhere and be like  just so you know  because you refuse to get vaccinated  baby and I have to miss out on Christmas  and you won t meet baby until s he is over a year old      I don t know how to start the conversation  We will be seeing at least some of them for Easter in a few weeks  We d like to discuss it early enough that they have time to smarten up and get vaccinated if they choose to   Or do I just keep my mouth shut  miss all the family gatherings for       months  and exclude them from any of our events without any explanation   Thanks for any suggestions   TLDR  how do you bring up word a conversation with family that they have to get vaccinated if they want to meet the new baby

569,0,Boyfriend repeats random memes and sounds when tired stressed bored  Up to       times a week My M    Boyfriend M    picks up a new sound and a random new meme approximately every month  It used to be a video of his friend saying something funny like  Daaddy piig  Oink oink   He played that video and repeated it verbally around        times  Now he makes a loud plop noise  he s working on getting it louder  and repeats it again and again and again and again  plus the whole Michael Jackson impression video word for word  I say stop  He apologises seemingly sincerely  but then just does it again after a few days  It was one of the reasons why I broke up with him before  We got back together because we really love each other  He s a super guy and I love him  No  he s not retarded  He s fairly mature for his age too  except this  Sometimes it s a whole day that gets ruined  and I get really stressed out  What do I do now 
570,0,I    M  have no idea how to recover from my    F  cheating About two years ago I broke up with my girlfriend because she was cheating   Actually she cheated on me with two people  I didn t think that was lovely    While we were broken up she moved to Souuth Carolina  Then this recent January we started talking  and we talked all of January  and she asked me to fly down  I m in Virginia   and help her move  she s sick with an autoimmune disease and sometimes I need help  And we d spent all January calling and texting about getting back together  I flew down  met her at the airport  and drive her up since she s too sick to drive long distances  Anyways  A day or two later I learn she had secretly been living with a boyfriend all January  I thought that was rather uncool of her  She said she d been living with him just because she had nowhere else to go  and she would have been homeless  and now that she was out of SC she was never going to speak to him again  So I hesitantly continued dating her    It s march now  I don t know how to deal with my severe trust issues  I just called her and said something like  I know we ve talked about this and you ve answered a lot of questions  but I still have severe problems and I don t know how to fix them  I don t feel you ve made an effort to overcome the problems  and this has been tormenting me  I want to be together but I need your help fixing this   And I essentially got berated and she threw her hands in the air saying I don t appreciate her  Which I think is clearly a bullshit diversion    Is there anything I can do to fix this  I know there probably isn t  but I want to think there is   I also am typing this here because after an hour of talking to her  I don t feel she s genuinely going to take steps to resolve things  She just wants me to say it s in the past  but I don t feel it is  And she s upset I m mentioning previous cheating    Anyways  I m typing this just so I know I can t find any way to fix this  I m dreading the coming months of emptiness  it s like staring into a pit that will suffocate me in darkness

572,0,    M  I m unsure if I should pursue this girl Sorry if it sounds obvious what I should do  but I m pretty retarded   I ve been talking to this girl for a couple of months now and have gone out with her a couple of times  I like her  but I really can t tell how into me she is  She often flakes on plans for other things  all of which are pretty reasonable since we re both busy  but she often tells me very last minute  so it s pretty annoying and kinda comes off as fake   Each time this has happened  we reschedule a different time to meet up  but it usually just leads to more flaking  It s ended up turning into this weird flaking cycle  All of the excuses are believable though  it just happens so much that I can t tell if it s horrendously bad communication issues or if I m actually getting messed with for some dumb ass reason    I m pretty tired of all of it  but I like her a lot  Am I just being super paranoid and slow witted  or is this kinda normal  Should I still try to keep pursuing her or just drop it    Again  sorry if this seems obvious or whatever  I m a dumb fuck 
573,0,Is it wrong to be cold towards someone you re financially dependent on  Me    F  and my father    M Hi  everyone  and thanks in advance for any advice you can offer   So I m currently a senior in high school  about ready to go to college  I got into to some pretty selective private schools  like top    schools in the country  but of course they are pretty expensive even with financial aid  and my parents will be paying much of the cost    My relationship with my father  though  is quite a convoluted one  Something happened around   years ago which I won t go into but it really damaged my relationship with him and I could never see him the same way again  He has been abusive towards me my whole childhood and it peaked   years ago but since then he has  mellowed  out  perhaps as a sort of reparation for what he did before  It has been a while since he has been physically or verbally aggressive towards me    Anyway  because of my hesitation to have a close relationship with him  I act quite coldly towards him  This is something I am working through with my therapist  but I think it will be a while until I am willing to let down the barriers I have put up in order to protect myself from him   Still  I am financially dependent on him  My mother frequently tells me I should act nicer sweeter more loving towards him  because of everything he s done for me will do for me by supporting me financially  But I can t stand the thought of acting like the sweet daughter they expect me to be   it s not part of my personality in the first place and even if it was  I don t think I could do it because just the thought of it makes me recoil    Yes I know theoretically I could go somewhere cheaper to get rid of this dilemma  or at least relieve some of the pressure  but I m quite ambitious and driven  Given the opportunity to attend one of the top schools in the country  I really would like to be able to   I am in desperate need of advice with this situation  Thanks again for reading  
574,0,My   F  girlfriend    F  is very anxious about getting on planesBad english   I ve had a conversation with her recently about this just a few hours ago    I already knew before we were dating that she was afraid about a lot of things  What I knew back then was that she was anxious  scared of  Cars  boats  tight spaces and horses  because they re big and might kick you in the head    One of them are planes  A bit anxious because of the fact that we re LDR   I told her that planes are much safer than cars  she s willing to get in cars  and that they don t crash very often  She said that any percentage were enough for her and she didn t want to risk that  And that planes were in fewer numbers so of course they d have fewer accidents   wouldn t the percentage be higher as well   She almost had a panic attack by just thinking about travelling to my country to visit   I mean  I m probably going to visit her instead when I can  but the fact that she was this anxious about going on planes scares me   TL DR  Girlfriend is scared of going on planes  We re LDR

576,0,So my  F    boyfriend    M  has gone solo travelling for   weeks with the possibility of seeing an ex fling and i am very uncomfortable with it but can t say anything about it  Advice please Me and my boyfriend have been together for   months and everything was going pretty great  however a month into the relationship   late january   he told me that he was going to be going to thailand for   weeks at the end of march  Obviously i was a little anxious seeing as Thailand is known for it s sex tourism  but i trust him not to do anything stupid while he s out there  However  a week before he flew out he told me that there was a possibility that he was going to see an ex   online   fling while he is out there  This kinda set up the whole anxiety again  but i didn t say anything because i didn t want to seem like a massive bitch about the whole situation because i should be happy for him   and i am   but the whole situation is starting to stress me out and make me question the entire relationship as over the past   weeks it feels as though he has been putting less effort into the relationship  which in turn makes me feel even worse aboiut everything going on  I feel as though i can voice any of these feelings to him because he s been saving up to go on this trip since december  and i don t want to ruin the trip at all for him  i ve tried talking to friends about it but almost everyone of them basically told me he was going to cheat  which just made me feel like shit      TL DR  My boyfriend is away for   weeks in thailand  probably seeing an ex fling for the last week while he s there  i feel as though i can t say anything because i don t want to ruin his trip  friends are super unsupportive to the point of making me feel worse      Can i please get any advice on this situation  and am i just being a majory unsupportive bitch or are my worries justified 
577,0,I     F  love my boyfriend     M   but I find myself noticing other men in ways I haven t before We ve been together for three years now  we ve lived together majority of it because rent is cheaper  we ve always gone        He s had health issues in the past and I ve been there every step of the way to figuring it out  We re best friends and I love him to pieces  but recently I really like we ve grown apart  I know change is inevitable  I expect it  But change in my relationship like this shouldn t be normal    We ve started to fight about everything  From having no sugar to fighting about who s opinion is correct  and it hurts me  We talk  because he s always been on top of that  but when I express to him that I want to be loved like this  not like that  or that it s us against the situation and that we shouldn t be battling each other  he responds with his words and actions for the rest of the day but when tomorrow comes it s like we ve began in the same spot    Recently I ve changed jobs  and there is one guy who I work with who I ve started to  notice  a little more than I should  We don t work in the same department and rarely cross paths  but when so I ve found myself smirking when we make eye contact  then I start to get butterflies and my heart begins racing  Why doesn t my boyfriend make me feel like that anymore    I love the life we ve created and imagined in the future  and I feel like I owe it to him to work on us and that I should stay with him  but I m so ready to just throw in the towel and be single again    Is that normal  Did we rush into things  Should I focus on us  or is there something terrible in store for my near future  
578,0,My    f  boyfriend    m  is overly concerned for my  integrity  causing me to feel oppressed My partner and I have been enjoying each other for the last   years  This has been an ongoing disagreement between us  and I don t know how to help us see eye to eye    Earlier today we were eating lunch on the ground level patio  It s a beautiful day  The patio is not private though and faces a street and across the street there is a popular walking path  There were some teenage boys  about       yo  out there on their skateboards and hanging out doing whatever  I stood up and bent to kiss my partner who was still seated to thank him for lunch before going inside  He was immediately uncomfortable and told me not to bend over to kiss him because the boys across the street could see my butt  That really ticked me off  I m wearing jeans and a t shirt and a cardigan that covers my butt  I m not a provocative dresser  nor do I give two shits if my rear end is visible to the world  This is      and my rear is absolutely not exposed  This is definitely not the first time he s said something like this and we have had many arguments like this because of my butt before  I ll admit  it is nice   His reasoning is that he s looking out for my integrity  This seems extreme to me  but I know he s coming from a good place  I can understand that if I were fall down drunk after a night out and some body parts made unexpected appearances  it would be very appreciated  but that has never happened to me  I can take care of my own integrity and I can guarantee that it won t be compromised by skateboarders admiring my Levi s  Like I said  this is a reoccurring situation  Not exactly like this every time but close enough that I don t need to elaborate on each event    I feel that my partner is insecure about others noticing me  so he asks me to change my behavior or clothing  This frustrates me because I know I m not doing anything wrong and I cannot change the actions of others  It feels oppressive and controlling that I should dress or behave how he thinks I should just to avoid an argument stemmed by his insecurity    So  Reddit  do you have any insight for me  How do I navigate this 
579,0,After three months of dating  sexual exclusivity and a vacation spent together  the girl    F  that I    M am seeing still refuses to define the relationshipWhats up reddit  I cant afford a therapist so here goes nothing    I ve spent the last year of my life living as sort of a nomad or gypsy  I graduated college in Hawaii  traveled across Central America to teach scuba diving and finally moved to the midwest to start graduate school  I met a girl here who I quickly developed a deep fondness for  She s in art school and I m perpetually awe struck by the pieces she creates  I ve been romantically involved with an assortment of different characters throughout my adolescence and early adulthood  but I ve never felt such an overwhelming attraction and care for another human being before  We ve see each other generally twice a week since we started dating three months ago  I even took her on a trip to the Florida Keys where I taught her how to SCUBA dive  Whenever we spend the day together we have sex between     times within a    hour span  its like nothing I ve ever experinced  Our physical intimacy extends beyond the bedroom  we hold hands and kiss in public  We can  and often do talk for hours upon hours on end as time slips away  We ve both agreed to stop seeing other people  and only have sex with eachother   Yet she wont define the relationship  Frankly it infuriates me  She came to my apartment yesterday and when we were cuddling on the couch she whispered to me   I REALLY REALLY like you  but that fucking terrifying  I sort of pressed her on it  trying to figure out what exactly she meant  Whenever I try to broach the subject of  defining the relationship  shes resistant   Her last boyfriend was a violent coke head who broke her heart  that much I know  I also know she s afraid I m going to move back to Hawaii again to go to grad school there instead  She s also told me  in a display of drunken candor  that because I m bi sexual she fears I m going to be using her as a  beard    Should I press harder  Should I wait it out  Should I find someone else  am I chasing my tail

587,0,I    F  recently broke up with my boyfriend    M  of    year  then found out he d been in another LTR the whole time    We met online on Match com in November       The first several months of our relationship were really great but moved slowly  he had commitment issues and I wasn t in a rush so we were both okay with that   We saw each other regularly   times a week  usually a weekday after work and then a weekend day with a sleepover  but no more  he played soccer about three times a week so he didn t have much time to see me and I also had my own life going on   We were affectionate in public  he put effort into getting to know my parents and family  and I was introduced to the people he would run into  coworkers  acquaintances  parents of kids he coached   but he didn t introduce me to his friends or family    His family lives in Ireland  He s been in Canada for     years  he told me he didn t have close friends here  and that his friends here are mostly  soccer bros  with whom he didn t seem to do much with other than play soccer and drink beer  The most important people in his life here were a family who  adopted  him  He said he had dated one of the sisters briefly several years ago and he became close with the father at that time  which was a relationship that continued after the sister broke up with him  The sister he dated moved away temporarily and he continued his relationship with the family  the sister is now back but it was so long ago that it was a non issue   The complication was that the mother of the family was critically ill after month   and passed away in month    and after that he said it was uncomfortable for him to introduce me to them during this time of grief  although he assured me they did know about me   By month    my feelings were getting pretty serious and I wanted our relationship to progress   specifically  for us to spend more time together and for me to be more involved in his life   At the time he was living in a nearby suburb   about a    minute drive from me  He had a place in my city that he d leased out to someone else and intended to move back to eventually  he suggested he could vacate his tenants and move in so that we could spend more time together  This did not happen at that time   However  he was consistently there for me  I felt consistently adored and emotionally supported  In month    I broke my foot and he rushed to the hospital after his soccer game  waited with me  took me home and carried me up the stairs to my third floor apartment  In month    he went camping for the long weekend with me and my closest friends  He was kind and loving and made himself a significant part of my life    Around month    I finally went to his apartment for the first time  He had said early on that he rented a room from a female roommate who he suspected was on the spectrum and was generally uncomfortable with strangers in her space  He justified these parameters with incredibly cheap rent  that he saw this as a temporary arrangement while he saved up some money and he wasn t home much anyways  I was curious about his place but had not been curious enough to make an issue of it  nor did I really want to make a trip out to the suburbs   my apartment is in a great part of the city and generally located between his workplace and his suburb     He was living in a two bedroom apartment with one bed  he told me he slept in a sleeping bag on a mat on the floor of the second bedroom  His rationale was that the room was too small to fit a bed after his computer desk and other personal belongings and again  this was temporary  He admitted that he hadn t shared that particular detail because he was  embarrassed of his squalor   His clothes and personal belongings seemed wholly contained within the second bedroom with the rest of his things  ie books  in storage  At the time  I thought this was strange but in keeping with his frugal tendencies  and thought nothing more   We had a serious talk in month   where I asked him what he wanted with me  He indicated he wanted to be my boyfriend and I set out my needs expectations for that  which included more involvement in his life and a commitment to give firm notice to his tenants  which he agreed to  He also began exhibiting his struggles with vulnerability and commitment  and what bringing me deeper into his life meant against those issues  and we agreed to work together on it and discussed his going to counselling   None of these things came to pass  He didn t go to counselling for his issues  he didn t move to the city  and we didn t start spending any more time together  As a result of this  things declined quickly and drastically in month    and I broke up with him  I was unhappy with our relationship  his fear of vulnerability and refusal to let me in hurt me  and it had become clear that wouldn t change   I was devastated  We kept talking and the breakup dragged on for months  We would just have so many talks  He would consider going to therapy and we would discuss his fears desires to change grow  During this time  he attended my parents  joint birthday dinner and my adopted parents  fundraiser  and discussed a trip to Europe in the spring during which I would meet his family   We continued acting like we were potentially going to be together for the long haul  so I couldn t help but keep my hopes up   Throughout  he was unsure about himself and felt certain he would continue disappointing me  didn t feel worthy and didn t think he could make me happy etc etc  I kept giving him more time and space to figure out what he wanted  reassured him that I didn t agree with him on the above points  but finally after zero action from him the breakup was finalized at month      A few days after we broke up  my best friend shared her theory about him  He had a double life  She came to this theory during our breaking up months while summarizing explaining the situation to her new girlfriend  which required her to step back and look at the entire saga as a whole    Upon some light sleuthing  it turns out he has been in a relationship with another woman for   years  with whom he lives  Surprise  She was the sister of the adopted family that never moved away  that never actually broke up with him   I can go through the red flags  and how he circumvented them  and white flags  things that still don t make sense or add up  logically or logistically or emotionally  in light of the truth  but in summary  he fooled my family  my two sets of very protective  adopted  parents  my close protective girlfriends and handfuls of other friends and acquaintances  I had been lied to before  on a much less serious basis  and so my people are protective but  likely given his somewhat bumbling  dorky charm  no one had a bad feeling about him  regardless of how much time they spent with us    When I found out  I reached out to his girlfriend with a letter informing her of the facts and did not force evidence on her  This post helped me with the decision to do this   https   www reddit com r AskWomen comments  uisos i  just  found  out  that  im  the  other  woman  if  you   https   www reddit com r AskWomen comments  uisos i just found out that im the other woman if you     His girlfriend acknowledged receipt but said nothing else  and asked me to respect her privacy moving forwards  which I have done    I gave myself a few weeks  during which I went to counselling  and when I was ready to confront him  I texted him for my things   including his keys to my apartment   and for an explanation  to which I have received no answer  I assume she told him about my letter but has done nothing else  I believe he s still on Match com  his profile is still active   In hindsight  he was emotionally manipulative  I didn t realize this at the time because he did it not by making me feel bad about myself  but by making me feel bad for him  As I began asking more of his time and his life  he painted himself as a flawed human being who was doing his best to love me but had not dealt with his trauma and issues until I came along and was struggling to make a choice to do the grueling work of healing himself  He took advantage of a trait I highly value in myself   my capacity for empathy   I am incredibly angry and I don t know what to do with it  I m not an angry negative person but also I ve never been good at letting things go  The things that my counsellor suggest  ie writing letters to him that will not be sent  don t seem to help  What do I do now   TL DR  Dated a guy for a year who was in another long term relationship the whole time  fooling me and everyone in my life  I m so angry and don t know what to do to make myself feel better

589,0,I    M  have grown really tired of a good friend    F  of three years due to what I believe is their compulsive lying Throwaway account due to the seriousness as well as the description will identify myself and the people involved   Me I  N  friend in question  M  really close mutual friend   back in august of      I met N due to her joining an activity here in college  she was a freshman and i was a senior in a leadership role  This person seemed really great at first  interesting major plus a long list of hobbies and accomplishments  as time goes on I start to get to know her and hear about her life  M also meets this person and gets to know her  Throughout the past few years I learn more about N s situation and how horrible her life has been  Fast forward to now and me and M are discussing how we do not believe her  We noticed that some of what she tells is is not relatively normal to happen  She claims to have had Cancer  Mrsa  and this past summer caught norovirus from her apartments tap water  The latter resulted in her coming back a few days latter perfectly fine but not able to defend herself since a director in our activity was under scrutiny for having a room professionally deep cleaned without reason  M and I are aware of several more lies that seemed relatively harmless  for example she once got a picture of a cat off the internet and claimed it belonged to someone she knew even though I saw it posted on Reddit and knew it was from an Asian country    amp  x   B   Here is where things really began to  get wild  She has told some things that I feel bad for doubting  These stories are fairly big and can have a dire effect if people did know  N claimed that she was homeless and lived out of her car in high school  this year a homeless student joined our activity who lives out of his van and N had no sympathy for this person though she claimed to lived a similar life  Another story involves her being in a head or crash and almost dying  this winter she was rammed off the road and her car spun out which resulted in her explaining how scared she was since this was her first car accident  The effects of the damage were also exaggerated  The car only had a bumper that was damaged and partially lost  She said she was fine but then fine turned into bruised ribs which became cracked ribs and ultimately broken ribs  She told me the story of how her best friend committed suicide in front of the entire school during lunch by shooting herself in the head  She in on the no fly list for a number of reasons ranging from her mom bringing people from the middle east for her dance studio to blaming her grandparent for being a very bad person of interest  She often flies from here to her hometown  And sadly she has explained multiple rape stories which are tragic  ranging from it being her grandparents as perpetrators to a different one involving a boy from school as well as having garbage thrown at her from protesters throwing trash at her at the planned parenthood clinic        in a state where it is beyond difficult to even have this procedure as a minor  she claimed this event lead her to switch schools even though she says she was in the same schools extracurricular programs all four years  I feel really bad for doubting her on this because I do not believe people lie this much but I cant be sure anymore  Anytime N sends me a message I ignore it  I lost all desire to interact with her but I cant do anything since M and I are the only people who know all of this  we are in a situation where if I do anything about it there will be large backlash from people and I am afraid of conflict   Her lies are always about her being a victim  Am I wrong for having doubts  what should I do   Edit   tl dr My believe my friend has lied about her tough life and I have grown tired of her    amp  x   B

595,0,Should I   F  break up with my boyfriend   M  because of my depression My friend passed away at the end of January and ever since then I ve been in a pretty not okay place  My confidence has been in the gutter too and it has been making me the jealous girlfriend and I hate being that person  Ive been trying my best to hold everything in so as not to burden him with my own problems  I can t afford a therapist right now  I know we would both be heartbroken if I ended things  but I cant help but feel like it would be better to let him go and not burden him anymore  I just feel dumb and confused  I try to break the cycle and be the most positive I can but in the end it just makes me feel fake and tired  
596,0,I set my Friend F     up with my cousin M     four years ago an now it has come back to bit me in the assSo I met this girl in college  seemed like a really nice girl at the time and was friendly  We had a few classes together so we just bonded  Well summer comes and at the time I don t have a car so she offers to help me move my things  We went to my aunts house to drop off a few of my things there and she met my aunt    My cousin is in the United States Marines  Just got out of a really bad relationship and as my aunt kind of got to know my friend she wanted and expressed to the both of us that she would like to set her up with my cousin  At the time I thought it was a great idea  Well that summer my other cousin  his sister  was getting married  So my aunt and I thought it would be cool to set them up then because he would be back on leave    They hit it off  talk for a while then after the wedding  Then my friend messages me telling me she can t do long distance and decided to stop taking to him  Which is fine  no one had hurt feelings    Then the next summer comes around and he s home on leave  Keep in mind my friend now lives three hours away and only comes to see me when there is a guy close to me that she wants for date or talk to and when my cousin is in town  So she invites her self over to stay at my house without even a days warning but I said okay    Now my cousin at the time was talking to a girl he had known for a very long time  Which I find out later that he was actually in a relationship with her at the time  But he still told my friend to come down so he can see her  Well on thing led to another and they ended up doing things one night  Which again was fine at the time till I realized that he cheated on his then girl friend    He when back to where he was stationed and my friend talked to him some more then said again that she didn t want a distant relationship   Well  she had three relationships since and was engaged for a while  And in between she would talk to my cousin    This last thanks giving she came down to see him again and invited herself without warning       AGAIN     she stayed with him at my aunts house for a few days and one night they asked my boyfriend and I out for a night  We went to the bowling ally that had a bar  We drank  played pool  All fun  Then she pulls me aside told me that she wanted to stay with my tonight because she felt like there was nothing between her and him and that he felt more like a brother to her  Well I told my boyfriend that she would be staying with us which is fine but he told his friend that is also home from the marines that he could stay  But him and I worked it out that they both could   I told my friend and she was interested in the new guy thats my boyfriends friend  So we all  including my cousin  went to another bar to meet up with my boyfriends friend  She thought he was cute and since she was as no longer interested in my cousin  she wanted to see where things went    So they spent the night together and when I drove her back to get her car from my aunts house she told me that she really like this new guy and wanted to see where things went  When we got to my aunts house she left without saying much to my cousin  kinda left him hanging    Well long story short  she was too clingy to the new guy and was saying that  even though they met only once fora few hours  she wanted to meet his family and talked about moving to where he is stationed and told him that she should leave the Marines  Which he didn t find appealing so he stopped talking to her   She kept messaging me asking me if he had said anything to my boyfriend and I kept saying no even though the things I he had mentioned would hurt her feelings    In the same week she said that she missed my cousin and that she wishes he was home  I reminded her of what she said to me that he was more of a brother and she said she didn t remember that she said it    A few weeks passed I get a text from her sending me screenshots of this girls Facebook that said she was in a relationship with my cousin since before the last time he saw my friend on thanksgiving  She emailed him  called him and I just didn t want to get in the middle  She then said she was over him and didn t understand why this would happen    Today she texted me saying she misses him and wants that photo I took of them the last time he was home so she can see it  My thoughts was that she was trying to either make him break up with his girlfriend or talk to the girl about him cheating  Either way I didn t want to get in the middle of it    My friends excuse was that she wanted the photo so she could just see them together  When I told her I don t have it  she said that my cousin told her that he is trying to break up with his current girlfriend so he can be with her  But had to get his stuff back first    I don t know but all of this a more has made me not like her  Putting me in the middle of my family and friend  Not only that but she s okay with his cheating on his other girlfriend and saying it s okay to break up a relationship          Like I said  she has done this and a ton more that I won t get into because it ll just all for a longer post    I am asking for help  I really don t know what to say at this point  Please let me know what you think I should do

598,0,He s talking to other girls  but we never established parameters   I     F  have been seeing a guy     M  for about     months now  We re both in college  we met on Tinder  we ve talked or seen each other every day since meeting  and have gotten pretty close  We tell each other that we like each other often  we get dinner and drinks  or we just cuddle on the couch and watch TV  We have sex  but it s definitely more than just a hookup  However  we never talked about intentions  which is typically how most Tinder things should start  So we never talked about being exclusive  I did assume  based on him liking me  and spending all this time with me  that he wasn t seeing anyone else  And I like him so much that I haven t been talking to other guys  so I hoped he was in the same boat    But I just discovered that he s on tinder talking to girls again  he had previously deleted it   He doesn t know that I know  I m just both paranoid and observant  so it wasn t that hard to figure out without invading his privacy  I feel hurt because of how we feel about each other  or how he says he feels about me   But since we never established parameters for the relationship  I don t know if I can blame him  because I don t know his intentions   On one hand  he could be an emotional player who just knows what to say to keep me around  and is lying to me on purpose  On the other hand  he could just be unsure of where I stand and is keeping his options open to make sure he doesn t get hurt if I m not fully in it   I just want to know the truth about how he feels about me  and why he s talking to other girls  I m not sure if I should just bring up  us  in general and see what he says  or if I should ask him directly about him talking to other girls    How should I approach confronting him about this    TL DR  The guy I m seeing is talking to other girls  but since we never talked about being exclusive  I don t know how to approach talking to him about it  
599,0,Been Left Hanging and Now I m Pissed Confused and SadMe    F  and my boyfriend    M  have been together for a year now and our relationship has moved pretty fast  At maybe four months we already talked about marriage and kids and what our goals in life were blah blah  Then at around maybe  six months he had already given me an engagement ring and asked if I would marry him  This is my first relationship and I just assumed that when he said that he loved me and that he wanted to be with me that he was telling the truth and that we would follow through with these plans  Fast forward to two months ago he started saying he was really busy with work and family and he went from texting me everyday at least a few times a day to going two days without texting me  I would have to initiate any conversations we had  And then every time we had made plans for a date or just to hang out he would always tell me that something came up and he was too busy  It felt like he was ghosting me after a whole year of a relationship  I got really upset about this and ended up giving him his ring back and saying that he was never serious about me  The next morning I was so embarrassed about how I had acted with him and went to his house to apologize  He said he was angry about what I had said but said everything was okay  But then he tells me that his family wants to move back to el salvador in the next couple months and that s why he has been so busy  I gave him some space for a week and texted him  He said that everything was fine  But  when I asked him about whether he is going to move back with his family he said he wasn t sure  I asked him if we would break up if he did move and no response all day  I texted him a few times and told him that I really wanted us to work and I was willing to move to him after I finish school if that was what he wanted  A day later and still no response  I called him and when he didn t pick up I thought that he was probably busy with work and just texted him sorry  He texted me immediately and told me   I love you okay  give me some time to think   After all this I just kind of feel like he wasn t as serious as I was about our relationship and maybe I should just break it off   He told me two weeks ago that he might move back and so I would think by now he would know what he wants to do and if he still wants me in his life but he doesn t  It s not like I m making him decide to stay with me and leave his family  I offered to go with him after I finish school  I ve been crying on and off all week and I feel like crap  Sorry for the long ass story and thanks for reading

602,0,Am I toxic for allegedly not caring for my friend s mental health  So some context first  I am an    year old high school student and my friend is a    year old    My friend  we ll call her Thanos  and I have been really close friends for about a year and a half now  One of the main reasons we re close friends is because we tell each other about our issues and support each other and offer help    Thanos has a lot more issues than I have  depression  anxiety  low self esteem  trust issues  PTSD  I ve always been able to comfort her and make her feel better about herself when she s having a crisis and she thanks me profusely for having a huge impact on her life  She says without me she would be dead    A few weeks ago we went to the mall to go watch a movie and she hadn t been to that mall since her abusive ex about a year ago  That ex was one of the worst people on the planet and because of him her depression worsened and she got trust issues and also got PTSD  At the mall  she told me randomly that she was gonna have a panic attack because she was remembering the places where her and her ex hung out   I tried to calm her down and told her to breathe and said  that s all in the past  he can t hurt you anymore     She got really mad and told me  that s not what you tell someone who has PTSD  Do you even know how it works   Then she wouldn t talk to me and left because her mom came to pick her up    I ve never dealt with anyone who has PTSD nor going through a panic attack  I m not a therapist so I m not gonna know exactly what to say every time    A few days ago she says her friends hate me because I m  toxic  and I asked why  She says it s because I m inconsiderate of Thanos  feelings and I never offer any help or support when it comes to her issues like they do  Thanos has a history of self harm and every time she tells me she s done it  I get mad  Not at her necessarily  but because of the fact that she thinks it s an OK thing to do and she expects me to just accept it as a normal thing that happens  Thanos told me her friends don t get mad at her when she tells them she cuts and instead all they do is offer the support she needs    I ll be honest  I m mentally exhausted from Thanos  Every day she tells me about how she wants to die and she hates her life and I do everything I can to show her she has worth and that I care deeply about her  But every single day it s the same thing that I really can t do anything about since it s not in my power  so I m just tired from saying the same things to her without it having any effect    Am I a shitty person   Am I toxic

607,0,Did I handle this wrong Hi all  just wondering if I handled this wrong  Things have been bumpy with my  gf  and she wanted a break as she said she doesn t have the time or mental capacity atm to facilitate in a person in her life and I ended things  She messaged me yesterday saying how we re on a learning curve and that she thinks about me daily  I said I respect her wishes and that she wants to focus on herself and if she s found someone she clicks better with that I m happy for her and that we can still be friends and hang out every now and then  She got annoyed at me And said I need to stop talking and bringing up other dudes as I m only hurting my self by thinking that in the end and it just escalated from there  Did I handle it wrong  I just meant that we re both free to see other people but now I m thinking I came off insecure by saying that  Let me know what you guys think  Cheers  
608,0,My relationship is falling apartMy so    m  and I    f  have been together most of our adult lives  We have   beautiful children together  We have a history of domestic abuse  It s been physical in the past but recently he has been putting me down whenever I try to talk about my feelings  He called me delusional  which I told him is emotional abuse  He told me to go away  He has recently become republican while I have always been liberal  He doesn t see me as an equal and it shows  While I do almost everything for the children and do all the laundry and most of the house work  he thinks he s more important because he pays the rent and most of the bills  I work    hours a week and pay for all the childcare expenses  He talks down to me when I try to talk about our issues  It s never a good time for him  He can be sweet and I honestly love him  But I can t get over his behavior  He had an abusive mother and he is dealing with alcoholism  He stopped drinking for me and I m afraid if I leave he will start again  I also don t really have anywhere to go and I can t afford to live on my own  He says if we break up he will get the kids  I m dealing with depression and I just can t take all of this  
609,0,Boyfriend      came out as asexual  how do I    F  support him So after a bit of a tiff and a long drawn out conversation last night  my boyfriend has told me that he believes he is asexual  This came as a bit of a surprise to me  because up until recently we had a pretty regular sex life  I chalked the dwindling up to us being sick at different times  me getting my period  stress with school  etc etc    I have always had a higher sex drive than him so I am used to not always ending the night with sleeping together  and I am okay with it  However  I don t think I could just stop having sex  that s not fair on me  He said he still wants sex  just not as often as we had been having it    I told him I needed some time to process my emotions  but if we decide it s healthier to end our romantic relationship now I will always support him and be there for him as a friend  This is definitely not ideal for me   I ve never felt this close to someone  we ve discussed marriage several times  and I love him with all my heart  I m still not sure if I      believe the asexual spiel either  due to some outside stuff   but I understand that sexuality is on a spectrum and am willing to give it some time to find a new  normal  for us  should we choose to continue as a couple   In the meantime  how are some ways that I can support him and let him know that I m not judging him for any of this  We ve talked briefly about finding alternative methods for intimacy  but I m drawing a blank here  This man is my best friend and he s beating himself up over this  and it hurts to watch    He s coming over tonight so we can figure this out  so any input is greatly appreciated  TIA 
610,0,Moving out but staying together  My boyfriend     m  and I    f  have been together for   years   I moved out   years ago   we had been together for around   months and he decided he would move out with me as we ll  This was our first time being on our own and sharing a space with another person  The year we spent living together was very tough and full of arguing and fighting   however our relationship seemed strong and he was even talking about marriage and proposing to me   he had even set a time frame    We struggled financially and emotionally a lot during that time   He was depressed and had car and money troubles   I paid for everything during this time including clothes  car repairs  food  bills  ect   eventually the lease on the apt ended and we decided to move in with his parents so we could save some money  grow together   and eventually move into our own place again  However   his attitude shifted a lot in the past months and as he began to succeed at work and become more financially stable  his attitude about our relationship changed  He began to say he wanted to take a step back and figure out some personal things before taking our relationship to the next level    he asked that I not speak about engagement or marriage as he felt pressured  I agreed and left it alone  He began to tell me he felt as though I never listened to his needs  wants and that I made everything about me  I worked hard to change that even though I did not necessarily think it was true as I worked hard to make sure his financial needs were met and even reminded him about payments   repairs to his car  appointments   and handled his school documents and debt  I was always working on helping him improve himself and his life in that way   A month after our conversation about me being too self absorbed   I find a text message he planned to send to someone asking for sex and a few days after that a handful of condoms in his bag  we don t use condoms   I was hurt and spent a lot of time moping and crying   he had enough and kicked me out of the house and asked for space without specifying anything about our relationship or living situation  I moved back in with my mom for a month and cried myself to sleep most days  He still asked to see me although I would be the only one to reach out   and suggested we spend some nights together   I would sleep over    Now the time came to talk about me moving back in and he has decided he is not ready and thinks our relationship is unhealthy  He says he felt manipulated and controlled and that a lot of things in his life were not his choice   but rather mine and that he wants to be his own person  He says he loves me but is not in love with me and my manipulative side and that he does not see himself living with me again any time soon  He is not willing to work on our deeper relationship issues  and he is also considering moving out with his best friend   I feel so hurt on so many levels and just betrayed  I feel like I did so much to help him and tried to be the best partner I could be but right now all he sees is that I ruined his life or made him do things he didn t want to  I don t know what to do  I honestly just want to end things as it feels like it s headed in that direction but I feel like I m not strong enough  How should I approach communicating with him     And yes I have told him how I feel and he has more or less mocked my emotions and called me immature for not being able to understand where he is coming from  
611,0, Kind of a repost   I    F  don t know how to ask out a guy    M      I posted this before but the answers I got missed an extremely important part of the issue so here I am again  explaining it again and hopefully clearer than I had before       A few weeks ago  I was messaged on a website from a guy who was convinced to become friends with me by a bot  Yes  like a bot on Discord  Anyway  despite him being high as a kite at the time  we kept talking  By now  the conversations have slowed down because I m too nervous to talk to him       I know as shady as it sounds  but I do trust him more than I would other internet friends  mostly do to the  I m bored  so here s a picture of me in math class from under the table while hiding my phone from the teacher  where I could see the standard high school desks and the posters on the back wall          We ended up following each other on various social media sites  I identify as bisexual  and I am usually attracted to girls much more than I am guys  however  this guy is pretty cute  The big issue is that we both live in the US  but in different states  We re five states away from each other  and the time zone difference makes contact hard enough as it is       He s more supportive than my friends and my past girlfriends were  and we talk a few times a week  Any tips on somehow moving forward with this relationship  and if not  how to strengthen the friendship that s already there   I ve never been great with people  and am unsure of what to do  or where this is heading as it is  and if there is a chance  I don t want it to slip away      
612,0,how can I redeem myself My longtime crush and I started really talking around october of last year and have been texting consistently for a few months  but recently  I ve been feeling a lack of  effort from their side  I m now usually the one that initiates conversations and their replies are now usually pretty short and dry  and I m almost always the last one to say something before getting left on read  always at the end of a conversation though   I don t think that there s any single thing that I did to cause this  Maybe they ve just realized that I m worthless and insecure piece of shit lol   I really like this person  and have for many years now  My feelings for them have always been on and off throughout my childhood  but my feelings have always  consistently returned to them   I know that this sub s general advice is to forget and move on  but we re both still really young and I really  truly do not think this is a lost cause  I know  however  that it s important that I don t try to force anything  that would be more detrimental than anything  Even if I try to push away my feelings  as I have done many times in the past  when I didn t know them that well and didn t think anything would come out of my feelings   I know for a fact that they ll inevitably come back  I don t know what to do at this point tbh   feelings are so damn confusing    thanks if anyone does end up replying 
613,0,Is there any way a age gap of    years can be normal      amp     I am     my boyfriends     We have dated for soon   year  Meaning i met him while i was     Now ive started loosing interest in the relationship  He has immense debts  takes   responsobility for his actions and im just tired of it  I think i might want to leave him  I still love him but im really unsure if this is a healthy relationship  He has never groomed me  He has always respected a no for no  He has treated me equally for the most part  Though hes said things like  i love your teenage body  etc that kinda creeped me out  Or hes said jokingly that its too his advantage that im mentally ill  bipolar  autism traits  social anxiety   because it means i struggle to meet new people which lowers my chances of leaving him  He said it in a joking manner but tbh i feel its a bit suspicious   Opinions  Hard truth please 
614,0,I     F  like to be the initiator or I m not into sex with BF     M I ll try to keep this short  Love each other      years  Attracted to each other   He s a very intelligent  bookworm guy  I m a little more wild social  I noticed a pattern since I ve been dating   only him    no one else   When my BF is busy  or focused on something  other than me  for a long period of time  I feel this strong desire to seduce him initiate then start sex   I like when he watches me initiate  idk  It just turns me on   BUT        Anytime  he  initiates sex  OR anytime he turns into the aggressor while I m  seducing him   I kinda lose interest    Example  I pull my boobs out  he gets up  comes over and starts grabbing them  I DON T like this    I still have sex of course  but it almost makes me    not as into it   Is there any way I can show him that i prefer this without verbally telling him  How should I tell him  
615,0,I always get bored with my SOs  is this normal It happens on a predictable   year cycle  The feelings of lust go away  I m not attracted to them anymore  and little things begin to annoy the hell out of me until the relationship falls apart  I love them from an early point in the relationship  but the little annoying things begin to bother me until the love erodes    I ve always blamed the other person  thought that something was wrong with them  but after repeating this cycle into my    s now I think there s something wrong with me    Is this what people mean when they say that a relationship takes work  I don t want to have to work to be with someone that I m not emotionally invested in  That s a chore    It s always the same pattern though  meet someone and start dating  a few months in find that they re the only one I call  then a few months after that I feel like I love them  The relationship is good with trips and memories and laughter until around the   year mark where it begins to fall apart  lust and physical attraction begin to fall off  little things that never bothered me begin to bother me  and I end up falling out of love and into a dead relationship  I end up staying with the person even during this stage  because they ve done nothing but be good to me  and I can t stand the idea of breaking up with them and hurting them when they ve done nothing to deserve it  I m not a cheater but I begin to get wandering eyes and wanting things I don t have   I always thought that the  right  person would come around and I d break out of this cycle  but I m not going to be dating age much longer and I don t want to spend my life alone  I want to share it with someone  and have those good times past the   year window    What am I doing wrong  
616,0,I  M    broke up with my emotionally damaged partner  F    and whom has sent some confusing messagesSo basic context  Question is below     in      i started dating my best friend form university  We had lost contact due to her previous boyfriend of   years while not physically abusive  and with best intentions  did purposefully keep her away from her friends and out of most contact with them      We dated after re connecting and being best friends again over three years  the third year we finally got together and fell in love  Unfortunately at our first argument we broke up rather than resolving it   around christmas  and she attempted to become friends again  It was in this time she opened up about an abusive father and previous boyfriends  stuff she had never revealed to anyone  She also told me beginning in march that she was still in love with me romantically  was heavily flirting and was upset that i had appeared to move on  as i had been tagged with another girl on Instagram       However i then discovered that she had started dating again before that point and had hooked up with her old BF  I severed contact at this point as i viewed it as an act of betrayal  specifically that she was hiding her BF from me  and meeting up with me from her new BF  as i had stated i wanted to get back together       My question is  should i still care  If the answer is yes how should i approach it        amp  x   B 
617,0,Friend   F  got drunk and told all my secrets    M  to another friendthrowaway because the friend in question follows my original account  Backstory  So I have two sets of friends in college  one is the girl I m talking about  she has the same course as mine  let s call her S  And the other is a group of friends who I live with  in a hostel  I also know one of these friends from childhood  let s name him K  K is the third friend in the title  Both the groups are very close to me    S went to meet an old friend while I was out with K  S calls me asking where I am because her friend had to go back home due to some emergency  I could sense that S was hammered drunk   so her friend M  wanted me to walk her home safely  So I asked her to come to my location and when K and I were done  we started walking back  Note that S knows K as well  we re in the same University   Now  I have a different equation with S  we connect on a more emotional level  that you don t do with guys usually  So she knows a lot about me  This will be important later   This started with S telling me how sad she was about a reddit post I had made earlier on who to choose between the two groups for a trip when their plans clashed  and I should ve talked to her about it    While walking back to her place  she started telling K that he should look for a stable relationship and not be influenced by me as I look for only physical ones and how I have various casual hookups lined at different places  And proceeds to tell him all different stuff about me  I need to say here  that I m not promiscuous by any means  But when I had a bad break up from my first  and very serious relationship  I spent the rest of the year hooking up with anyone I could find to get over it  Only S and I knew about this time of my life  But not even a week before this incident  K and I had a long talk  and I told him everything about this  but S didn t know I did this   So on one hand  I was okay with S telling K about all this  but on the other hand  This could ve been anyone else  And now I m rethinking the seriousness of our friendship   I don t know how to feel about this  is this normal  Am I thinking too much  Or am I justified in feeling betrayed   TL DR  Because of S telling all my secrets to K  I ve started doubting our friendship because for all she knew  K knew nothing about that part of my life and maybe this was something she always had in mind and the alcohol just made it easier  Is that Justified 
618,0,I F    need help with how my mother F    acts towards my daughter F     I ve been debating on posting but I m at my wits end  Please bare with me for being long  this may all be slightly jumbled  with possibly to much information   and some parts I may come off as bitchy   I can t explain express myself that well    Background   She had a hard life growing up     smoking at age    teens she was partying  drugs  etc     had me and my sister in same year  At      Planned    Nana kicked her out when she found out     Had   jobs to support us growing up     husbands   all abusive    I always had respect for her as being independent  had her shit together  don t need no man  As we get older we realize the flaws in adults  I don t feel bad for her   lots of details I m leaving out  but she made her bed and is now laying in it    I hold some resentment towards her  Yet  because she s my mom I still act like normal  forgiven her I suppose   Reasons being    She isolated me  I wasn t allowed anywhere without my sister   but she moved to my dads at age     It was either school  church  family or home  This made me become depressed and have suicidal thoughts  I d wake up and be on the computer everyday until  am  only way to be social   Example  I had a test at school  end of the year  because i didn t come straight home  she came to the school looking for me  saw me in the library and just broke down     her second husband molested me  I told her  she brought us home  sat us down  and told me I must of dreamt it but he wasn t allowed in my room  That was that  He did it again a couple weeks later  She left him on a whole different reason    There s a quite a few more  but those are stories for a different time    Moving on  My issue about her is how she is towards my daughter   I ve forgiven her for everything technically in my childhood but this is one thing I ll fight for    Important note  I do NOT ask her to watch my daughter  I have my in laws  I have my husband  I m a SAHM   I don t ever need her to take my daughter    When texts or calls  twice a day   it s all about her  how s your day   I ll reply  She ll instantly put it back to herself  My husband actually pointed it out  If I talk about anything about my day  she ll say something about her  completely disregarding what I was talking about  All she talks about constantly  she messages me at least twice a day    aches and pains   what she s doing   financial troubles  etc  She does not ask about her granddaughter at all    She tells me that I m welcomed anytime  but every time I do go over  she only interacts with me  She won t play or interact with my daughter at all    Or when she messages me that she s bored  I ll say  you could come and see your granddaughter   She ll then make up an excuse  no I need to do this  or  yeah  yeah   Then she won t    That being said  she strictly told me that she won t take my daughter unless my nephew M   is there   which she only sees once a month  Apparently by her logic if she takes her more than once a month I would be a part time parent   What the fuck  Another reason being that my nephew would be jealous  which is ridiculous  My sister fucked up so he lives with his other grandparents  He s   he doesn t give a shit    I  being reasonably upset about her logic  called her out on it  How it went was   So you pick up nephew on Friday  won t take daughter until Saturday afternoon around    pm  then I have to take her by Sunday early afternoon      am   you literally only get her for a day  which means that nephew would indeed actually get more time    Her response  Stop getting mad over free childcare   What made it worst was last month  she wanted me to watch nephew for   hours on Friday  saturday  amp  Sunday because she started going to the gym  I laughed  Seriously    I ve been keeping some distance from her  I thought that it may have clicked because I ll get random  I love you  texts  She texts that she misses me all the time  but she never texts that she misses my daughter    What really made me cry break my heart was actually last weekend  my mom invited me over for tea and dinner  She also said that we could play a game of cards  I replied that it would be hard to play a card game that takes an hour to get through with Daughter running around   Oh  I thought that it was husbands day off     Instead of my mom being  I miss my granddaughter    I want to spend time with her     I can t wait to see her   Like my MIL does   It s more so she takes her once a month out of obligation  Kill two birds with one stone with having her the same time as my nephew    Listen  growing up I saw my nana multiple times a week  she even lived with us for years at one point  so this is the expectation of a grandparent  With her being excited during my pregnancy  this attitude blind sided me completely    Even more of a laugh is that my mom deleted Facebook last summer out of jealousy  because she saw a post of MIL and daughter having fun    How do I make my mom want to see my daughter  Want to be with my daughter  Want to spend quality time with my daughter  I feel like all she thinks is that I just want her to watch her which I ve stated many times isn t true   that I literally DONT need her    This whole situation breaks my heart and partially makes me want to go no contact  Spending time with her granddaughter should be a fucking privilege  not a nuisance    I just want her  to want her granddaughter 
619,0,I m    f  frustrated by my    m  Indian bf  Is it cultural differences Hi everyone    Some background   I am a    yo white  American female who is dating a   yo Indian  Gujarati   American born male for   years  I love my boyfriend very much but unfortunately my patience is running thin with the state of our relationship and clashing cultural differences    My boyfriend and I met in college     years ago  We were friends at first and started dating at     We were roommates  parents didn t know  together with a bunch of people and started growing close and then started dating while living together  After college we moved our separate ways physically  him back with his parents and me independently  We ve been semi long distance for   years  and I only see him about once a week for a few hours since we have to sneak around    Problem  my boyfriend is still financially dependent      on his parents  He is trying to look for a job but hasn t had any luck  Because of this dependence  I feel like his parents control him and I m growing resentful of them  For one  he has STILL not yet told his parents that I exist or that he s dating someone  We ve had many conversations about this and I get the cultural implications of it but it has been   years so I m increasingly frustrated and growing impatient  I understand the beginning because of the no dating in Asian culture piece  but we ve been very serious together for a couple of years now  Because his parents don t know he s dating  we have to sneak around  He can t go out too often because he gets screamed at by his parents  When he does go out to see me he lies to them so he feels bad  We plan on telling them about us next month  but I m scared he won t stand up for me when if they disapprove as he hasn t shown he can yet  He s afraid to stand up to them as he thinks they ll kick him out and cut him off  Im afraid they re never going to let him come over or see me  He convinced me to trust him that he will stand up to them when he makes money  but I find it so hard to trust and believe this  I m      financially independent  have been for   years  and ready for the next step in our relationship  We talk about this and he is ready too mentally  but not ready because of his life instability  You can bet he can t catch a break from them because of this instability  We ve been stuck in this limbo for so long and we fight constantly about it because he doesn t believe he s being controlled and is frustrated being pulled all different ways  I try as hard as I can to be supportive but I feel I have cut him so much slack and am annoyed at our relationship since it s so abnormal   Please offer any advice or similar experiences  I love him so deeply he s so kind and funny and sweet  but this I feel this is ruining our relationship as my anger and resentment grows    TLDR  I m a white female with an Indian boyfriend who are in two different stages in life maturity wise  Indian boyfriend is still being controlled by parents and it s affecting our relationship  
620,0,My    F  best friend    M  is in love with my friend with benefits    M First off  I m sorry for the length of this post  Second  for context  we are all currently juniors in high school   For the past two months  I ve been seeing this guy  let s call him Pete  on a weekly basis  After going out once  Pete and I both agreed we weren t ready for a relationship at the time and decided to be friends with benefits  we haven t had sex  just fooled around in various ways    My best friend is a gay guy  let s call him Dan   Dan and I are super close  and share pretty much everything  He means so much to me  He s really closer to a family member than a friend   Now  Dan and Pete are good friends  After I told Dan some of the details of what we did  he told me he doesn t want me to talk about it anymore because he sees Pete like a brother and it s weird  Fair enough   But then  Dan started getting kind of distant with me  The friendship just felt weird  It was kind of heartbreaking for a while because I kept trying to connect with him and it just wasn t working  but eventually we talked and he said he felt it too  and that he thought we needed some space for a while  I initially agreed  But after a while I found I was having a hard time dealing with the separation and started talking to him again  without him really engaging in the conversation   I also talked to a mutual friend  who Dan goes to a lot with personal issues  about it because I didn t know why Dan was being so weird with me  The friend told me that he couldn t share what Dan had told me because it would invade his privacy  but that he still wanted to be my best friend and all and was just going through some stuff at the moment  and I really needed to give him space  Almost immediately after I finished this conversation  Dan messaged me saying he thought we needed to  take a break   I told him I d been talking to the mutual friend about it and that  after the conversation we had  I agreed with this   Throughout this period I was still meeting up with Pete quite often  and I was falling for him  By this point we d been meeting up for quite a while  and I was definitely beginning to have feelings  I haven t talked to him about this   About a week later  I went out with another mutual friend  let s call her Kate   While we were driving back home  Kate  who knew about Pete and I  told me she had something to tell me  She then told me that Dan  just a month prior to the beginning of Pete s and my arrangement  had confessed to her that he had serious feelings for Pete   I had absolutely no idea  Dan and never said anything to me   We ve actually fallen for the same guy before  so it s clear we have a similar type  But previously when we fell for the same guy it was at separate times and caused no conflict  Also  neither of us became involved with that guy in any way   So Reddit  what do I do about Dan and I s friendship 
621,0,I  college age  started talking to ex gf  college age  as  emotional friends   caught feelings and reacted poorlySo im gonna give you guys some background  I met this girl in highschool and she was great  but in a relationship so I never pursued anything  However  when senior year came around we both happened to be single and hit it off and ended up in a relationship  We were great and went to the same uni and dated for another two years  Fast forward to last summer  I was in a bad place mentally and wasn t able to give her the attention or time that she deserved and sort of distanced myself  We ended up breaking up due to some issues we both had but my side of the breakup was definitely due to the issues I had from being in a bad place   So fast forward again to this school year  We saw each other decently often bc we have similar hobbies but never really talked much due to thing being pretty awkward  But despite this  I still saw her as one of the few people I could go to with anything because she knew everything about me  So that winter  I hit her up and we met up and caught up and all that good stuff  However  during this time I was reaching out platonically  I didn t really have feelings for her  I then asked her if we could sorta lean on each other emotionally  so pretty much the emotional side of a relationship without the physicality or romance  She agreed and we went like that for like a month and a half  It was really fun and nice to have someone to talk to and I loved having my best friend back in my life  After that month though I realized my feelings had come back in full force  Side note  I had managed to turn myself around big time since the breakup and was in a much much better place   I ended up talking to her and telling her that I think I love her again and told her that the weird dynamic we have  it was pretty flirty  was painful if I knew it wasnt going to go anywhere    So  I gave her a sort of ultimatum  we have to stop talking or we should try our luck at another relationship  I figured that because these feelings were back I needed to act on them and either take the next step or remove myself to try and get over them  She seemed pretty distraught by the ultimatum and told me she feels the same way but couldnt be in a relationship because she was really trying to work on herself and focus on her own life fair enough   So    I cut her out of my life  Its been a couple months and we re sorta talking again but not that regularly  I still care about her so I can t help but feel like im the asshole for jumping into her life again only to leave so soon  I wanted to protect myself but I m afraid I hurt her in the process    Now when we talk she always seems excited to tell me things and listens intently to the things I have to say  I know I love this girl despite that weird relationship we had a few months ago but I dont know what to do with those feelings   I can drop them and forget about it or level with her again  My issue is that when I gave the ultimatum I wanted to work things out instead to find out what she wanted but hindsight is       I guess  This is someone that I really don t want out of my life but at the same time I may not be thinking rationally  What do you guys and gals think   TLDR  Sparked things up with an old girlfriend  we became a sort of emotional pair without romance or physicality  I caught feels and after a while told her I needed a relationship or couldnt do it anymore  Now idk what to do
622,0,Girlfriend  F     mad on me  M     because of my mental problemsHey everyone   I study quite far away from my home and from my girlfriend  so I have a room at the place where I study and go home in the weekend  Last week I collapsed in my room  I went to the hospital and they checked everything  They couldn t find something  I ve had some big mental problems in the past and after I came back from the hospital those issues seem to came back  So last monday I went to my study place again  but I couldn t focus and was stressed for no reason  I decided to go back  Tomorrow I have a test and I really want to overcome my fear so I went to my place again   The problem is that the parents of my girlfiend were so shocked that I came back earlier and they thought I was not being serious in my study and that I m not a good person for her  I never did her or her parents wrong  My girlfriend defended me and was angry on her parents  but suddendly this morning  she started to get angry on me  that I should go to my study place and she told me she was angry that I came home earlier    My girlfriend also has some mental problems and insecurities  I ve always helped her without judging or anything  I did that with love   So I can t understand it  she knows what mental problems are  but she is still mad  I have no idea what to do
623,0,My    f  boyfriend    m  freaked out on me when I told him our friend implied his mom slept with an older manSo for context   my boyfriend and I have been together   years  I m not a huge fan of his mom for the majority of our relationship and as of the last year  I definitely haven t been too fond of her  She has been in the midst of a divorce with his father and always has something bad to say about him  She has also done a successful job at turning her kids against him because he won t pay her alimony   One of my good friends was invited to live with her for a few months while he was in college  She lived on a nice elderly community on the beach so it was a nice place for him to live  He paid rent and would fuck off for a few days when she asked him too  Now he seemed to get to know her really well within those   months  We had dinner together  the two of us  while I was in town and he told me some things about her   First off my friend said she had spending a lot of nights with her older friend  like   s  shes in her   s  and staying the night there  He lived in the same community  He also told me this guy would buy her dinners and wear her around town like arm candy  He also said Sam s mom would go into detail about her endeavors with other guys which made him uncomfortable  All of this was going on right before the divorce and during it    Fast forward to now   my boyfriend is on the phone with his mom and she s complaining about his father not paying alimony  per usual  My boyfriend said to his mom  dad never hits me up  only when he needs something or when you guys are fighting   I corrected him in a low voice cause his dad did text him yesterday saying he thinks of him often and misses him  My boyfriend resents him however because he asked my boyfriend to pick up the payment for his student loans which he refuses to do    Anyways  later on  once they re off the phone he brings that up and how he doesnt like me defending his dad  I told him there s probably a deeper reason as to why his dad isn t paying her even though he does have money  He asked me what is it  So I told him maybe his father is mad at her for being with her best friend s husband now  who they ve both known each other for many years   Or maybe he resents her for hanging out with older men or hooking up with other guys so soon after their divorce  I mentioned that my friend had implied she spent one too many nights at her older friend s house    My boyfriend got very defensive and borderline abusive  He started to yell at me telling me she would never sleep with that old guy cause he apparently  disgusted  her  And I said  well she wouldn t tell you if she did  And he asked me why would she do that   so i said maybe because she wasn t doing so great financially and he helped her out    My boyfriend pushed me  threw my phone  tore out the tapestry and told me I called his mother a whore and a prostitute  I never said those words in any way shape or form  He called me a dumb cunt and an idiot many times    We argued for quite a bit and he stormed off and said he wants nothing to do with me  I am feeling so overwhelmed and lost because I m not sure if all of that warranted his behavior  I get his mom means a lot to him but why would he completely deny that she could have relations with that guy  My friend would not lie about her behavior or morals  And given what she recently did to her best friend of    years   it s made me realize she s not above doing anything really   How do I fix this and make it better  I just want to make this work  I really do feel bad for speaking my truth and what I perceived to be the truth  I feel like his mom has painted such a shitty picture of his dad but can t help but think she is just hungry for his money or anyone s money really   and nothing more   Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated  Thanks for hearing me out     TL DR     My good friend lived with my boyfriend s mom for a while and told me she slept around and would spend the night at her older friend s place too often  I told my boyfriend maybe that s why his dad won t pay her alimony  He got physical with me and yelled at me   
624,0,A question  albeit I m sure one that is posed more often than not I ll do my best to keep it concise and short  Me   M  and  possible gf     F      Basically here s what it boils down to  myself and   F are great friends from a long time ago  We dated for a short period back between            Had a great time dating and we left on  Kinda OK ground    I took it fairly hard  she was my first REAL partner     F went off  started her own business  had a few rough patches with other men  and now she s single  Just the other day  we hit it off again  She came over  we drank  laughed  told stories  etc    the general stuff that you talk about  It seems like she still has interest in me and I definitely am still interested in her  To make a long story short     How do I ask her back out without ruining the friendship or making it seem awkward   Take in mind that I have always been a very charismatic person  but the second I try to speak about  love  or  connections   I get the whole heart in my throat feeling  and that is after working up the courage too 
625,0,My    M  GF    F  of   years is an avid nose picker and wipes her boogers on our furniture  our clothing  and eats them as if they re a delicacy  Needless to say  I m fucking appalled Some background info  My girlfriend  lets call her  Janice  and I have been dating for   absolutely wonderous years  Of course we have had our ups and our downs  but we always manage to get back on our feet with some solid communication  She is an amazing girlfriend who I can be a dude around and just have a blast with everyday  She doesn t judge me and I don t judge her  and that s how it s always been   However  for the past few months  I d say starting around November  I ve been noticing out of the corner of my eye Janice will dig her fingers up her nostrils searching for gold  At first I thought to myself   Well we all do it  it s normal   I might have been right but the thing that irked the absolute fuck out of me is what she does with the golden nuggets once they ve been mined   Mind you  I didn t say much to her about the topic up until about two weeks ago  So for the time prior  I just observed    You would think the woman would grab a napkin or wash her hands after some good ol  berry picking right  WRONG  I never noticed or even gave a single thought about what she did with them  until  one day  I was coming from the restroom and back into the living room  I literally saw her pull her finger out  look at it  and wipe it on the arm rest of our beautiful suede sofa  SUEDE  ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE PURCHASES OF MY LIFE   At this point I m fucking appalled and I can t help but feel my throat tighten and my fried eggs from that morning try to force their way up my fucking tube  I couldn t even bring myself to talk to her about it just yet due to an overwhelming case of second hand embarrassment  Needless to say  that night I couldn t get MY berries hard  I chalked it up to a bad case of stomach pains or some stupid shit like that   But wait  There s more   As the great Billy Mays used to say   I don t know what was going on following the first encounter  but I guess she started assuming I wasn t noticing what the fuck was she was doing  She continued this behavior  except it seemed to be more often than usual  unless I was just catching her doing her business more considering I had light on the situation  Whatever it was  it became worse and increasingly disgusting   I was washing our laundry one day and noticed the clothes were stuck to each other in some places  Admittedly  I thought it was me who made the clothes sticky  because well  that s what socks are for ifyaknowhwhatahmean  If you know you know   But I noticed the stickiness was affecting other clothes like our shirts  sweats  and a few pieces of underwear  And they weren t huge splotches  rather  they were tiny individual spots of stuck together fabric    on random articles of clothing  I reckoned maybe she would wipe them there as she passed by the laundry basket  I couldn t take it then  no words could explain how disgusted I became in that very moment  Unfortunately I had to hold my feelings in  We were heading over to her in laws place in about an hour  and I didn t want to spark any kind of embarrassment in her that would affect her mood    Fast forward to about two weeks ago  Well  prior to this  I would just clean up after her  sometimes noticing she would wipe up her mess herself  Didn t make the situation any better obviously  but it was enough to keep me sane   I m showering in our bathroom  getting ready for bed and some freaky time  when I walk out on my unsuspecting gf  She had her finger in her mouth  and initially I thought she was trying to tease me by doing the old finger sucking trick  But my eyes trail down and she has her tablet in her other hand  and clearly was not attempting some sexual tease  I pretend like everything is normal and put my clothes in the hamper   She pulls her finger out of her mouth and starts chewing  but not like she was chewing a candy or anything  I could tell her was breaking up something small in her mouth  and thats when it clicked  Ugh even typing this makes me wanna fucking hurl   At this point  I m looking at her as if I just saw the most yack worthy situation unfold before my eyes    What   She goes    Did you just    eat that  I try to say without gagging   Needless to say  the conversation continued with me calling her out on the aforementioned events  I assured her that its absolutely normal  but I would obviously prefer she use a napkin and wash her hands afterwards  She was upset  but I m sure it was due to her embarrassment   I felt so relieved in that moment   The week following that conversation  AKA last week  she had either done it in private or taken my advice and used a napkin  I haven t seen any of our laundry in the same state it was before  and the furniture had been deep cleaned as well  however  I noticed that she has kept the habit of eating the shit she digs out still  I don t know what the appeal is   I kind of just refuse to kiss her if I know she d done it that day  Regardless  I tend to just brush my teeth like a fucking maniac as much as I can  It s driving me crazy   Should I just let her  Or should I talk to her again  What the fuck do I do 
626,0,White lies that mean bigger issues I ll keep this short  Been dating my girlfriend for nearly   years  Lately I ve been feeling a little insecure and it has reflected a little on my relationship  I ve been jealous of my girlfriend liking photos of other guys on instagram  etc  Anyhow thats all been dealt with and we talked it out   However  earlier this week my girlfriend and I planned to go out for lunch near her work  However today she cancelled on me saying she has a busy day tomorrow and would not make it    She shares her location with me at all times on iphone and I noticed she ended up going to that restaurant today  I would have been okay with it if she just told me the truth but I asked her what she had for lunch and she ended up just saying she brought lunch which means shes lying   Not sure why she would lie about something like this but I also don t want to look like im monitoring where she is  which i swear i don t usually do     Is something like this worth bringing up  or should i just let it go  What do you guys think   in short   gf and me had lunch date at special spot near her work  she cancels day before  i find out through share my location that she actual went to the restaurant today  i have no problem with that if she told me the truth  but she lied and told me she brought lunch  should i confront or let it go  
627,0,BF     m  Can t Hold a Job  Should I Stay or Should I Go I have been with my boyfriend for   years     f  and     m  and the entire time of us dating he has not been able to keep a job for more than   months and has never had a car  which is important to have where we live   When we first started dating I didn t think it mattered that he couldn t hold a job because he was still in his mid twenties but as time has gone on  I am wondering now if he ever will be able to keep a job and every few months he tells me his big plans to make money but never follows through or even start the steps to get to his goals  The jobs he has had are minimal wage jobs  he has a record  minor charges   and has an associate degree in arts and science from a community college where we live  which makes me concern about the job opportunities that he can have  I have tried to help him but he won t listen to me and when I am at work he just plays video games  smokes  drink  and skateboards and leaves the house a complete MESS  which I have to clean up when I get home  we live together   The last few months I have been considering moving to another state for a job offer I got and I have been debating if I should bring him with me  not sure if he would even want to go  or break it off  I mentioned to him about moving and he said that we should move to country in Europe and because the  parties there are wild   Am I being shallow  I don t need him to make a lot of money  I just want him to have a goal or even have a steady job so the financial pressure isn t all on me  I also want kids in the future and I want them to have a steady environment to grow up in  which is also another concern I have staying with him  Also  with all my free time all I want to do is mountain bike  I try to do it     times a week  and he will do it once an awhile with me but doesn t get why I want to do it all the time and gets mad at me when I go out and bike  I do want to mention that our personalities go well together  minus this part  and that I have a lot of fun and also have deep conversations with him  which I haven t found in another guy 
628,0,Wife    F  and I    M  want to start a family but disagree about vaccinating our would be children We have no children yet  but  we want to have children   She wants to start trying to conceive a child ASAP  partly because her age related pregnancy risks are increasing rapidly   We have not started trying to conceive yet  in part because I m unwilling to compromise with her about  not  vaccinating our would be children   She wants to delay and space out any vaccinations that our kids would receive and wants to skip most vaccines entirely   She feels convinced that most vaccines are unnecessary because she believes that most of the diseases for which we could vaccinate are usually mild  rarely have significant lasting impact  other than immunity   and can be overcome with attentive care and good nutrition  e g    rotavirus is just bad diarrhea  I ll keep our kid hydrated     She also believes that vaccines can increase the risk of neurological problems  digestive problems  auto immunity  allergy  and or dietary intolerance   I feel convinced that our kids probably will be protected better with vaccines than without  and that we should delay skip vaccines only if doing so is medically necessary or strongly recommended  according to a medical doctor who otherwise would vaccinate    I believe the apparent majority consensus  of apparently most immunological experts  that  for most recipients  vaccines are almost always safe and are appreciably effective   My unwillingness  thus far  to compromise on this issue has precipitated no small amount of distress in our relationship  and is a deal beaker for my wife  in her words    For my part  I feel convinced that compromising on this issue would violate both my conscience and my deep desire to protect our would be kids   We have discussed this together at length with a licensed psychotherapist  who has recommended that I compromise about vaccination   Notably and regrettably  we did not discuss vaccination  or any other health related aspect of child rearing  before marrying   Advice  reddit  about how whether to compromise about vaccination 
629,0,Four years after dropping me flat my    M ex    F contacts me to get back together out of the blueWe had dated each other for four years and one day with no warning signs or any inkling of an indication she tells me that she did not want to be tied down and wanted to break up and live her life   I had a ring bought and everything     In her breakup speech she told me that she saw herself living the rest of her life with me but that she felt she was to young and wanted to  sow her wild oats  but get back together when we were older   I was heartbroken  devastated and any other adjective you want to use   I had  a ring bought  thankfully hadn t given it to her  and everything   I wanted to merry her and live my life with her and be with her forever   She wanted to  remain friends  whatever that means but I just could not do it   I was not going to sit back while she hopped from man to man to man and try and pretend like everything was fine   So I cut contact with her and have avoided her at all costs for the past four years   Initially she kept tying to reach out to me but after changing phone numbers and ignoring all messages from her she stopped trying   The last time was about       years ago    amp  x   B   Life has moved on   Don t get me wrong I had a horrible time dealing with this  I was depressed for a couple of years and eventually had to get put on medication because I was going to lose my job if I didn t   But after   years I finally got to the point where I didn t wake up everyday wanting to end myself   Then out of the blue yesterday she shows up at my door as I m getting home from work   I didn t see her till it was to late and she acted like no time had past since the last time I saw her   I try to make excuses to go inside but she keeps on talking and then she hits me with this bombshell   She said she had talked to my friends and found out that I was not seeing anyone and she wanted to know if I would consider us getting back together   I was stunned   I mean to me the audacity in this comment was just beyond belief   She interrupted me from even answering her by saying that she knows she ambushed me and that she wants me to actually think about it and she wants to meet Friday night to talk about it and if nothing else just to catch up     Have you ever had one of those moments where life is going so fast it seems like slow motion   Well that is what happened to me  I felt like a punching bag and had a million things in my head I wanted to say but didn t end up saying a thing other than  ok       OK  like some dumb ass  that is what I said   She got in her car and left   I have to many emotions to not make this post      words so I ll just say this   I think I pretty much hate her for what she did to me   However I did love her for a long time and did want to marry her   I am a mess   I would like some helpful advice or even just a swift kick in the ass would be fine as well

632,0,I    f  don t know how to tell my SO    f  that I don t think we re meant to beThrowaway for the usual reasons    I m in my first serious relationship   ish months   but I don t think things are going well  We re not connecting like we used to and I don t think we have similar enough goals and values for it truly work in the long run  I don t want either of us to be more hurt than necessary so I think it s time we had a serious conversation about our relationship before things go much further  The problem is that I m not totally sure what the best way to broach the subject is  My SO has kind of severe anxiety  so I m not sure if it s best to let them know beforehand that we need to have a serious convo  or if that would just add more anxiety and stress to the situation  Or would it better if I set up a time to come over and then tell them we need to talk when I get there  Idk  I ve never done this before  and I really wanna make sure I handle it in a respectful way

634,0,No trust in relationship  Time to walk away      I do not know where else to go since I am too poor to afford therapy so hopefully you guys can give me some input    To give a little bit of a background my SO and I were friends with benefits before we got together  Once I became pregnant that is when we became official    run for the hills right    Well during my pregnancy I still lived with my parents  He would sleep over maybe once a week but used to go out with friends the rest of those days   this is important to me  I expressed my concerns and it changed once we moved in together  It has been a very interesting last couple of years  He does things here and there that bring me to suspect that he might not be completely honest with me  I m going to list a few examples to see if someone else see s what I see     amp  x   B      A year ago his GM had passed      and we attended his funeral  The whole day he was super stand offish and      did not show any kind of affection towards me  As soon as one of his females      coworkers game in he rushed and greeted her with a hug  Normally I wouldn t      care but given that he didn t let me hold his hand I raised hell over it  but      ultimately since it was a funeral decided to let it go      A few weeks ago I      noticed a pair of shoes were outside our bedroom where covered in grass       Little weird because he had spent the previous two days with me and we didn t      go out anywhere with freshly cut grass  I noticed the shoes in the morning      and they were mid wet along with the grass   my first thought was maybe he left      through the night  I didn t question it because I wanted concrete evidence      before accusing him of it     I recently bought him a      new iphone and showed him the  send my current location feature  I had      mine on  so he could see it   because my biggest fear is getting kidnapped      and he turned his on for me so it could be a       thing  Well the day of       when I found the wet grassy shoes  he had turned off his location  When I      asked him via text message he completely ignored it so I turned my off and      I didn t bring it up      He works as a server and      gets out kind of late  I looked at his location and it did not ping at      work it pinged in a neighborhood about   min away  I screenshot it and      saved it for my records   that following Sunday same thing but at a      different location  I called him out on that one and he says he went to buy      some weed from a coworker  I kept it in my mind       Yesterday I texted him      about   different times and none of my messages delivered  similar to when      the cell is off  I called and no answer  He turned on the locate me through      our text and it could not ping him     minutes later he calls me and tells      me he had just gotten off work   it was Wednesday and super dead they      close at    and he came home at            Am I over reacting  I have attempted to bring this up but I am always told that I am always trying to argue or that I am crazy  Arguments happen so often  I am exhausted  I have expressed to him that we need some time apart but we always go back to pretending that talk never happened  I Can t trust him  I don t think I ever will trust him  All those instances I brought up have always come back to him going out when I was pregnant  Did he do things when I was pregnant  He claims he didn t but I don t know  My gut tells me not to trust him   Do you think there is a way to recover trust  How do people co parent successfully  How does one move on from their child other parents  I am full of doubt 
635,0,I    M  want to go on a trip with my friend    F  but my girlfriend    F  doesn t want me to go Things are pretty heated between the two of right now   I met my girlfriend at a part time job I had last year  After I left we kept in touch and we started dating about a year ago  I moved in with her last January  Things have been going well  I m    and still in college but she is    with a steady job  hence why I moved in with her   Now I have this good friend of mine who is also my age  My girlfriend doesn t exactly like that my best friend is female  but she tolerates it  Me and my friend have gone on a   day trip every year since we turned     We both like exploring new cities and we usually pick a date when one of our favorite artists are there so it s just a fun weekend  I have hooked up with her a few times but this stopped even before me and my girlfriend started dating  and she knows this  The last time we went on a trip was when I just started seeing my girlfriend  but we booked another trip that s coming up   week from now   I told my girlfriend about this trip and she said she was fine with it  I asked if she wanted to tag along  but she declined  Now yesterday I was telling her about the hotel we re staying at and I said we were staying in the same room on separate beds  She kind of freaked out on me and became suspicious  and after a lot of arguing she told me she didn t want me to go because she feels uncomfortable about it  This is   week before the trip and I really don t want to call it off now  I assured my girlfriend nothing was happening between us and offered to sleep on the couch there instead but she didn t like that either   I ve known my friend for a long time  She s in a relationship as well and her boyfriend is fine with it  We will be sleeping on separate beds but in the same room  I don t see a huge problem with that  I ve tried to talk to my girlfriend but she won t budge  I understand her concerns  but I feel like letting me know it s not cool   week before the trip is kinda shitty  I should have mentioned the hotel room thing sooner  but in my book it s not a big deal    We ve gotten a lot of shit already for our age gap so I would rather not see people talk about that  I mentioned it because I m pretty sure she s insecure about the relationship between me and my friend because she s so much younger 
636,0,I don t know if I can trust my girlfriend and it s killing meIt sucks because she is an absolutely amazing person and I really want to love her I ve been with her for   years and we ve had some amazing memories together  I moved to a different country I don t speak the language very well and I absolutely despise her family  that s another story  basically they all act richer than they are because her granddad has money  and over the past few years I ve been very open with her about my depression and have even considered climbing to the roof of our apartment building and jumping off  She is supportive and acts like she cares but whenever I bring up the idea of seeing a therapist she gets moody and changes the subject or just keeps saying  we ll get through this together  I don t want to get through this together I want to see a licensed therapist who I can openly talk to   Now here s where I m the asshole  I ve been lying to her for a long time I told her I quit drugs  nothing heavy just weed  and told her I don t smoke it anymore  that part had been true for the past year since I moved to her home country but before that I would go to a friend s house  when she allowed me to  sometimes she would cry if I asked to leave  to smoke weed I just needed an escape from it we were talking on Skype nearly      if I wanted to go to my kitchen in my home country I had to take her with me on my phone if I wanted to go to the toilet I had to keep in constant contact with her and I couldn t handle it now as I said I m in a country I don t speak the language  I don t have a job  Im entirely reliant on her I don t even know how much money we have and I have tried to end things with her before I told her I don t think I could do it anymore and she somehow convinced me that things would change and that we wouldn t be on Skype every single day or we could have a more relaxed approach and for a while that s exactly what it was and everytime I tried to pull away she would promise things would change and I don t know I can trust her if I broke up with her that she would let me go  I d be completely reliant on her getting me to the airport  paying for my tickets and not trying to convince me to stay  I need help  I need mental help I need to see a doctor and I feel like she won t let me   I m due to go home to see my family in June and I intend to tell her the truth about everything there  she will be with me for the trip so if she leaves me she ll be flying back to her home country alone which is the only way I feel like I can do it because I have mistrust and I hate myself for not   Fuck I m sorry I can t do this  
637,0,Boyfriend    M  German  and me    F  Mex  gettin married for visa proposes but he s not loving me anymore So  long story short  I went to Germany to study   year and a half there  At the few weeks of being there I met this german guy and we started going out and date officially  We got along pretty well and couple months later for save some money and mutual agreement we decided to live together   It was perfect  until the date when my visa expires got close so we started talking about options and we decided that I will get back to study my master and it will only take me one year  And he will visit me in the mean time   When I arrive back to MX the perfect plan of getting back in   months to Germany was total ruined by mexican and german burocracy  It was so stressfull and it was a huge amount of money involved that Germany ask for visa requirements  that I got so frustraded and told my bf that the best solution was to get married  He totally panicked and just pussy out bc he said it was too much responsability for him and he never plan to marry ever   So it was pretty sad and we broke up for a month or so and after we talk we realized that we love each other and it was other ways than marriage   So we continue and try to survive  me  mostly  and just going foward  Then he cancel coming to MX and that add just more tension to our relationship but we were just holding   Over a month and a half ago  the requierments for the german visa got pretty much impossible for me to go foward  So we thought we will break up bc of that and we were pretty sad for a week or so  Until he said he needed to confess me something and if after this I still love him he will marry me  and basically was that he had sex w other girl  only sex  not feelings  and he want the freedom to still do it  Which yes it hurt me AF  but I always thought is natural to get atracted by other persons not just one  so yeah whatever we let it go   And we start planning the wedding thing and as time goes by I started noticing that he procastinate A LOT on getting his papers done  And I started to PUSH him and ask for things get faster  And this add a lot of tension to our relationship and I started to noticied him distance and many times I asked what is going  is you ok  all good  And his answers were  all good  all cool w me  nothing wrong   A few days ago  we had a fight and he basically told me that he dont see me as his partner anymore  that he doesnt love me anymore  That he feels on a cage w me  But bc I am important to him and he wants the best for me  he ll marry me anyways   I told him that if he is consceous that we need to live together for the visa requiements and he said yes  is no prob for him to sleep on the same bed  or share the same space  maybe things flow  maybe not but he doesnt want to give me false hopes of us getting back together  But he will do and stay marry as much as need   I am cluless on what to do  staying in MX is not an option for me  butnot having him asI planned it kills me too   TL DR    Boyfriend and I getting married for visa proposes but not loving each other anymore  Should we do it

640,0,   f  mixed signals from    m This is going to sound so dramatic  but here s the haps  I love this boy I ve known the past    years  Though we ve become distanced in highschool we both have not forgotten each other  But the problem is that he just won t talk to me  It s awkward  we ve grown apart  but our feelings definitely speak  He always purposefully walks past me in the hallway whenever he can  it just bothers me that he is always with his friends    We re both about to graduate highschool  and I think we both know we re running out of time  I m absolutely certain he likes me as much as I like him  but what s the point if neither of us are brave enough to do anything about it  He still comes to see me in the hallway but now he ll look down at his phone even when he s walking with his friends  He looks up at me for a second and casually looks back down   It s really frustrating to me  I just don t understand why he s doing this  is he trying to tell me he doesn t like me anymore  But then why does he purposefully wait to see me in the hallway  He goes out of his way  and if he really doesn t have feelings anymore  why not just avoid me   It s a silly concept I know  but it s breaking my heart  What would you do in my situation 
641,0,my    F  dog tore her ACL  my mother is giving me medical advice and it s stressing me out  how do i deal with this throwaway just in case     so my dog tore her ACL a few weeks ago   she s about    pounds of loving  chill    or    year old mutt   the vet advised me that the best option was surgery  specifically a fairly invasive one since she s a larger dog and the less invasive option only seems to work for smaller dogs   i want my dog to get better and have as easy a return to mobility as possible  the surgery i m planning to go with seems to be the best option to make that happen   as soon as i told my parents about it  not really looking for advice  my mother emailed everyone she knew that had ever possibly had a dog asking for advice  then forwarded all the emails to me   she also did a bunch of  research  and keeps telling me that doing surgery would be cruel and terrible and i should just wait for the leg to heal on its own     it s ironic that my mother is talking about cruelty when she cut up a fabric doll she made for me in front of me when she was pissed at me  shut me in the garage once because she got angry when my brother washed his hands on top of already washed broccoli  and generally made my childhood pretty scary   i still get twitchy when people yell at or near me      needless to say  her sporadic but super insistent messaging stresses me the fuck out   i cried for    minutes last week because it reminded me so much of how scared i was as a kid     my relationship with my dad is good right now  and i d like to be able to talk to him about the situation  he s offered to drive us to and from the surgery since my parents live close  which is great since i don t have a car    my mom seems to be able to message me from his accounts on a lot of platforms though  so i m not sure how to talk to him about this without her knowing and getting pissed off   i m sure if i delete the app she s using to talk at me right now  from her own account at least  thank god  or ignore her  she ll find another channel to yell at me through   i m still too scared to tell her to stop  and i m sure it would turn into an argument that i don t have the capacity to deal with right now     the bottom line is  i really don t know how to deal with this   any advice  sorry for the novel 
642,0,Why don t my kids see themselves as obese  Are they blind  Stupid  Worthless 
643,0,My    M  girlfriend    F  is extremely friendly and forward with everyone including guys  and its causing some problemsone of the reasons I love my girlfriend is that she s very very outgoing  joyful and positive  She befriends everyone she meets  male  female  young  old   However  sometimes she goes out of her way to befriend people too intensely  She does this to men and women equally  but it s when she does it to guys that it s caused arguments  For example  she ll meet one of my guy friends once  and then she ll immediately begin messaging him to make conversation  sending memes she thinks he d like and inviting him out with us   It came to a head when there was a new guy at my work who wanted new friends  and I invited him to drinks with me  my girlfriend  and some of my friends  the guy got belligerently drunk and ruined everyones night  so we didnt invite him out again  My girlfriend agreed that he  sucked    After that though  she invited him to   of our parties gettogethers and messaged him every time asking him to please come  After I told her that made me uncomfortable and I couldn t understand why she would do that when he was just a guy her boyfriend introduced her to     and did not want to see again  She said it was because she felt bad for him that he needed friends and that she had a right to message him   This makes me very uncomfortable because    guys probably assume she s interested in them when she goes and messages them so much randomly and    she had pretended to agree that she didn t want him around again either  but then decides to message him repeatedly anyways  Even if it were a girl she were messaging  I feel like it d be a little bit of a strange betrayal   I think she doesn t realise how people perceive her when she does this  a couple people have made comments to me saying they think my gf has feelings for xyz person because she has messaged them a lot  Am I in the wrong for being uncomfortable with this  or is there a way I can get her to tone it down 
644,0,I always get the ones who are taken  Hi guys I m new to Reddit so don t give me shit  I work at a Costco and I ve been there for a good amount of time   years  so I m a sense I m a Seasoned Employee and one day we got a batch of seasonal workers for the      holiday October January  season  There s this specific girl who s filipina and she was so cute  instantly caught my attention so I introduced myself  Instead of going head on and asking for a number or social media s I gradually built a connection and talked to her about random things  When my birthday came around in December  I decided to invite her to come bar hopping since it s like a fuck it why not  That same night I sensed a connection because of the way she talked and how instantly she pulled me and bought me a beer  Continuing the story  we hung out at my friends house and smoked  before dispersing  However things changed and she became more nice and flirty  There were nights after that night where I would invite her to smoke and we would in her car right after work and just the type of things we talked about we were relatable  body image issues  ideologies  music preferences  etc  I did not want to get my hopes up because there was rumors of her being bi and having a girlfriend  Fast forward one night we go and eat with coworkers and end up drinking beer and smoking and we kissed and held hands until she retracted and said  why am I holding your hand    to which I responded   because maybe you like this   Then she tells me she wants to be  BFF s  and she s with her gf still  so I ignore that because I hate the friend zone  Finally now it is March we go out for her birthday and I meet this girlfriend of hers  she keeps starring me down and giving me faces  Being the man I am  I don t care and ignore it  However the girl is being flirty with me  wanting to play pool with me and even pouring some of her liquor into my cup  As a result I get blocked from her Instagram  my  happy birthday  text is ignored and my number is ignored  Please guys help a brotha out  She s an interesting girl but I don t want to break down a happy home
645,0,He    M  broke up with me because of timing and I    F  don t know what to do or how to feelWe ve been together since December but only really put a title on it almost   months ago  The title didn t really change anything because we acted like we were dating for months prior   We are long distance and he s a senior in college  It s his last month in college and his last month playing a sport for his college that he has played his whole life  I have always kept my expectations low because he has a very busy life as a student athlete  We would text a few times a day  FaceTime for    minutes every other night  and see each other about once a month  Everything was amazing and I have never had a relationship so mature and loving    Last night he facetimed me because he asked to talk  He went straight into it and said it s his last month and a half of college and his season and if he doesn t put      of himself into the sport and enjoying every last moment with his friends  he ll regret it the rest of his life  I understand that   What I don t understand is how I am getting in the way  I said I don t expect much from him and barely talk throughout the day and he said when we don t talk he s still thinking about me and worrying about me  I ve never given him anything to worry about  I m busy too and yes I think of him throughout the day but we ve had a mature relationship where we respect each other s individual lives  I only ever want the best for him and for him to be happy while I can be there to support him   He said it s not me  Cliche but he said it s just the timing right now  He said I m the best girlfriend he s ever had and I ve done so much for him and I don t understand why suddenly that means he doesn t want me in his life   I need answers from him but it s hard to reach him during the day and what I can t figure out is how I should take this  I asked if it was permanent and he said it didn t have to be permanent but if that s what I wanted that s what i want  I m confused because HE is the one breaking up with me    He said he still would reach out occasionally just not as much as he has been this semester  if it was okay with me  I can t wrap my head around how he feels and he doesn t talk about his feelings very well    I slept   hours last night and have not been able to function in classes or in general today  I don t know how to feel  He didn t say if this is a break or a breakup and when I asked he said he  doesn t know what the future holds  and he believes if it was meant to be that we will be together again   If he just needed a month to himself I wouldn t even be upset about that  I could take that month to focus on finishing up the semester and final exams and focusing on my studies  But he wasn t clear if this was a break or a breakup and still wasn t clear when I asked   I am so lost and I don t know how to feel or how to act or how to talk to him  This is tearing me down and I don t know what to do  I know that clarification will come from him if he decides to stop being so confusing but I don t know what to do for now  Does this sound like a break or a breakup  Does anyone have advice  
646,0,my girlfriend    f  breaks up with me    m  for no good reason and i am still heartbroken with no idea what to do  please read and help me outhello reddit  ive been struggling with this for a long time and decided to come here for maybe some help or advice  me    M  somehow managed to get into a relationship with the girl of my dreams  literally the most perfect girl out there it always seemed like it was too good to be true  and now that it is over it seems like it was  but let me explain    it started with us regularly hanging out as friends for a few months  we go to and live at the same college so it was easy to be around eachtother  things were surprisingly really nice  i wasnt nervous around her and it was so easy to talk to her  one night i go out to a party and get drunk  i then confess that i like her and have strong feelings for her  she says she didnt think it was like that and it seemed bad from there  somehow we ended up making plans together over thanksgiving break  we went out together and it was incredible  spent the whole day together and at the end of the day she kisses me   this is important   and says she likes me and has no reason not to  from there everything just gets better and it was crazy  we hang out more and more  we have a relationship now and it was amazing  we go back to school and everything is perfect  we sleep together a few days a week  go to the gym together   i am a bigger guy  which she tells me she is into btw   eat together etc     amp  x   B   this is where it gets important tho  winter break for college is coming up and i need to clear up a few details now  when we decided to have a relationship she explained that we will be dating and basically be boyfriend and girlfriend but she doesnt like the labels because it apparently made her past relationships feel rushed and made things bad  so i understood this and never even called her my girlfriend but everyone knew we were dating and she is a very loyal and strong person  but  as we went into our first month together she became obsessed with me  i did treat her very very good  but she was obsessed  she would say how im the best boyfriend and that she is a proud girlfriend  she would post about me on instagram and snapchat  she would tell her friends and family about me and tell me that everyone loves me and is so happy for her  everything seemed really good and i have never been happier     right before winter break she tells me that she loves me  she said it first and i followed becuase i knew from very early on that i had really strong feelings for her but i did not want to be the first one  she tells me that i am all shes ever wanted     i took her to new york city for the weekend after that and spoiled her there too  had sex for the first time and it was a normal thing after that  life was great  i was loving and and she was too    so winter break starts and this is where she starts talking about how she wants to marry me and that i am stuck with her and that our kids would look beautiful and all of this stuff  now i am hearing this from the girl of my dreams and i loved it  but i never said any of that stuff to her    winter break was about    days  and we were together once a week  she lived in a different city so we could only be together   to   days a week at a time  we were together on christmas and new years  exchanged gifts and new years kiss whole deal whatever  we went on dates and did all kind of stuff together  i spoiled this girl and i didnt mind doing it because i loved this girl so much        important  then towards the end of break i notice her become a little distant  talking about how she cant wait to see her friends and i was never controlling of obssessive  i always gave her space so things didnt get boring  so we get back to school and the first week goes by and i only see her once  the second week she tells me she wants to hang out and thats when she tells me that she is getting freaked out by how fast everything is moving  she says she wants time alone and that she felt like it was either we break up or get married  she told me she didnt want anything with anyone else and if she was going to have anything then it would be with me  she told me that she sees a future with me  i didnt expect this at all and was and still am completely heart broken  this girl that said all this stuff to me about never wanting to leave me and that i was perfect and wanted to marry me and all of this stuff  and the love felt so real  it was the realest and truest love ive ever felt  i didnt know what to do with myself i felt  like my purpose was gone     amp  x   B   the next week i get into an accident on campus  i get hit by a car and get taken to the hospital     stitches in my leg  cant walk for   weeks  while is was in the hospital she broke her silence calling me like crazy to see if i was okay and after i leave the hospital i come back to school  she comes to see me and i try to talk about us  she wasnt having it  this is where she said somethings i still think about to this day   youre not the answer to all my questions  and  if you thought you were going to make me feel guilty and come back then youre wrong   i was hurt by this so much i didnt know what to even say  she tells me her that i was the right person at the wrong time     amp  x   B   the next moring she texts me saying if i need anything to let her know and she will help me  i ignore it     amp  x   B   a week or so later she texts me saying she misses me and that she feels like she is not allowed to talk to me because im mad  i explain none of this makes sense  she says that she doesnt deserve what i do for her and that i am too good to her but that i am      cuffable     amp  x   B   valentines day is coming up and her birthday is the day after valentines day  the whole time this is going on i have to see her going out to parties and stuff worrying about her getting with other guys and it kills me     amp  x   B   week of valentines day comes and my leg gets infected  i have to go home cause i get very sick  i leave a valentines gift for her to get early and i go home  she gets it and texts me  she says she is worried about me and wished that i said something to her  valentines and her birthday pass and i see things on snapchat that i dont like  i text her out of anger saying she was right that she didnt deserve what i do for her and that i want my shit back when i get back to school  i call her a lier for saying what she said to me then breaking up with me for no reason     amp  x   B   i get back to school and she really wants to talk to me but i just want my things  i can walk now and i go to her room to get my things we talk  very upsetting  she tells me she stil thinks i am her future  but i leave with my things and text her after saying i didnt want to leave and that she didnt want me to go     amp  x   B   a week later i was forced to drop out for the semseter due to a lot of missed school and i havent seen her in almost   months  i think about her everyday  it feels like i am depressed  i know what i want from life and i know this girl is what i want but i dont know what to even so  how can someone got from being so in love and so obssessed to not talking at all and being oaky with that  its crazy to me  i am a very loving person and am not an asshole at all  i

647,0,What would explain my    m  once close friend s    f  actions over the last year  Constant mixed signals  I don t know what kind of presence she wants of me in her life  and I don t think I can continue knowing her We met senior year in college and quickly became very close friends  At the time she was in a serious  long term relationship and I didn t see anything more than friendship   We ended up in different parts of the state after college  although I am currently trying to move to her current city   but we talked literally every day about anything    At the start of last year I realized I had developed some pretty serious feelings for her  and that she was someone I wanted to be with  Unrelated to that  around the same time she broke up with her boyfriend and started dating someone else after a couple weeks  I ended up telling her that I had to step away from our friendship because of how I felt  She made it clear that everything was perfectly fine between us  but understood   She reached out to me over the summer saying she missed our friendship  I missed it too  and thought I would try to be  mature  and put my feelings aside  Everything seemed normal as ever for a bit  but then one day she just disappeared and didn t say a word to me for months   I got a random message from her in the early winter like nothing happened  and I replied to what she was asking about  and then she never responded   In the new year she emailed me saying how much she struggled balancing life work  She was also going through a big issue with her boyfriend and asked for my advice and felt like I was the person who would know what to do  She ended her message saying knowing I read her email and felt something for her might be enough   I didn t expect our friendship to resume  but I replied to her with my honest advice  won t turn down a friend in need   Again we reconnected and everything was exactly like our old friendship  I was wary  but was still giving it a go  She was making plans to see me and everything  then one day she doesn t respond to random message of mine  and I don t hear from her in over a month   I was pretty hurt for a while because in the back of my mind I knew this would happen  It s like three times where she just disappears and makes me feel like crap about myself  Like I m the only one that cares and that I don t matter   A few days ago I got a short letter in the mail from her  She said that she wanted to send me a postcard last summer with something sweet and melancholic and honest  but forgot  and that this letter was supposed to make up for that  That s all it said  Like  I don t know what to do with that  I don t understand what she wants of me  But I m pretty sure I m not going to write her back   I ve kinda come to the conclusion that she just wants my validation or attention or something  But I find that very hard to accept considering what our friendship was  She never seems malicious or anything  and is maybe the most tender  honest person I ve ever met   I should note that over differing times in random conversations or about my other relations  she s called me handsome  sexy  fuckable  etc   but each of those times it s honestly seemed like more of a friend thing  I don t know though   I know there are tons of details you guys don t have  but I m wondering if maybe there are some perspectives I haven t thought of that could explain what s going on  I honestly don t know what to think or feel   tl dr  very close friend constantly disappears from my life after genuinely wanting to reconnect  I m wondering if the friendship has been reduced to a one way yearning for attention 
648,0,Would it be ok to start a friendship with an ex friend So I ve been thinking about this lately and I wondered if it would be ok to start a friendship with an ex friend    I mean we had a bit of drama  long story  but we ve gotten past it and acknowledged that we were both stupid in the situation  We ve had a bit of small talk after the situation but I feel like it s about time we fix the friendship we once had  since I shared a lot in common with them and enjoyed their presence    Yet  idk if it s the right decision since I ve suggested being friends again with this person with my friends and they strongly advised against it  ig they still have a grudge against them   idk if I should go with my gut or listen to my friends 
649,0,How to keep a relationship spicy   F      amp  M    I feel my husband and I have hit a null point in our relationship  We ve been together for   yrs  married for almost    We have a   yr old son    We don t go on dates  mostly because of our son  I d love to  we have a friend who could watch him  No family nearby unfortunately  My SO always seems to make excuses as to why we can t  Even before our son we didn t go on dates  and if we did I had to basically petition for it to happen  What s even more frustrating is he makes time for his buddies  frequently on Saturday nights and i m stuck at home watching our little one  When I go see my friend i always take my son with me  I d love to get dressed up and look good for my man  but it s kind of ridiculous trying when it s always at home and trying to arrange time together around our son s schedule   I love my husband and don t want to continue on the path that we are on  I don t think it s good for either of us  and definitely tough on the marriage  I almost feel silly for posting this  I know what everyone will say  Make time  set date nights  go out try new things together  I ve heard it all before but my husband just doesn t seem on board  I can t be the only one who tries    what a mess  Sorry if I don t respond to everyone and sorry if formatting is weird  Any advice is appreciated  
650,0,I don t know if he trusts me  is this a red flag I ve been dating Jake for   months  We haven t had any issues and we ve definitely never stolen from one another  He dabs and smokes every now and then  I let him know that s not really my thing and it s never been a problem  I noticed I started not seeing any dab pens around his place and figured he had just stopped  I didn t think twice about it  that is until today  As we re getting our stuff together  about to go out  he mumbled  ohh you ve seen my hiding place now I have to change it    I had no idea what he was talking about  I was just chilling  I asked him what he was hiding  casually  and he told me he was hiding his dab pens  I didn t touch on it because we were in the process of leaving but I don t know what to think  Does he think I m that shady that I d steal from him  Feels like he doesn t trust me  
651,0,I left my best friend for a job and it s hitting me  Hard As the title says      A little bit of background  We re both young and in college  We met nearly two years ago and had a decent friendship for the first school year  Dated for the second   I broke it off because the job I landed is six months long and requires me to be away from college for a semester      I feel confident that the distance placed between us would have ultimately driven us apart from one another  My biggest fear is that if we stayed together  she would have missed out on opportunities to learn more about what she wants and what she doesn t  and I d feel awful by taking that away from her and keeping up an LDR  especially when I know I ll be fully immersed in work many states away for six months  I wouldn t exactly be the most attentive      In terms of the relationship  it really couldn t have been much better  She was my rock during a few hard times I had  and I was hers  We both experienced highs and lows  and for the most part every conversation was filled to the brim with laughter  We were bound to one another  If I was talking and stopped midway  she could pretty much finish my sentence for me and be right on point  I feel like we both learned a lot about what we want out of life and developed so much as people  Without getting corny  hours felt like minutes when I was with her      It wrecked me to end it  I did it right as she brought up spending the summer where I would be working with me     I know it was for the best  and I have never felt worse about ending a relationship  I literally only want the best for her  So I m asking    Should I have even done that  or am I a fool   If you ve been in a great relationship but had to end it because you knew life was going to get in the way  how did you cope    Did you wind up being friends again 
652,0,We ve  F    M    been together for    years  recently moved in together and he s incredibly negative about EVERYTHING We got together at     and I realised a while ago there was a gap in maturity which I always thought was normal and a good reason behind why he would seem very apathetic about things    Fast forward    years and we ve just bought our first home together  We ve had fallings out through the years  and about   years ago broke up for a period of about   months before getting back together again  I would say all of our break ups have stemmed from me getting frustrated at his apathy over things like  spending time together  doing activities as a couple  or even coming up with suggestions himself on how we could spend the day   It s always been one sided  and where I suggest something I m met with apathy or negativity  I will NEVER receive a text during the day to ask me if I wanted to go out that night  or visit a local beach over the weekend  I come home every day and he s playing FIFA  and it ll continue all evening until he s ready to go to bed   He ll never suggest a meal to cook  or a suggestion on how we could decorate our home together  Our garden needs work and after approaching him letting him know I would like us to try and renovate it ourselves he laughed at me and said  yeah whatever it ll never get done    I love him  and I love the person he is  When we re around other people he suddenly becomes this incredibly energetic and charismatic person  but on our own he s a completely different personality  I just feel as though I m not receiving any love back  we ve fallen out a few times since moving in together over this  and it just seems to be falling on deaf ears  I hate feeling like I m forcing him to spend time with me  or receiving a childish answer when I suggest something like watching a meteor shower with  ugh  gay      I really want us to stay together because when things are good  they re really good  and we can have fun but I would say about     of the time I m met with shrugging shoulders or a  whatever  it s up to you   At the moment it feels as though there s no conversations of any substance    He ll go on and on talking about his workday  I don t mind this at all  I m genuinely interested in how his day has been  it s a nice reprieve from the gaming   but as soon as it s my time to speak he s gone  PlayStation is switched on and I ve lost him for the evening  I honestly understand allowing time for each other s hobbies but it would be nice to have someone have an interest in my day  or hold a conversation with in the evenings    I m obviously not communicating my unhappiness in a way he can understand  because we ve been through my feelings an absolute shit load  and for a short period of time things will improve but say  a fortnight later it s back to the same as before    This can t just be a personality trait that I m trying to change  surely this behaviour isn t healthy  I just want him to show he cares in more ways than making me a coffee at the same time he s making his own    I m sorry I ve rambled on  I m just upset after coming in from our bi annual forced evening walk where he pouted the entire time   
653,0,My    M  boyfriend is pressuring me    F  to attend his family reunion As a bit of background  my boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over   years  I ve met his immediate family but not extended    His niece has a high school graduation coming up in May and his whole family will be flying out to attend  He wants me to fly up with him to celebrate and meet his family  But here s the catch  he isn t interested in making our own accommodations  Instead wants us to rent a cabin in an RV park that his parents will be staying at for the duration of our trip   Now  I m a suburban lady  I ve never been camping  Everything about camping is a huge turnoff to me  especially the part about being stuck with no rental car or literally being bound at the hip to his parents for   days   I have met his mom and dad before  and his mother is very opinionated  likes things to go exactly her way  Of course nobody ever disagrees with her plan except for myself  The last time we visited  we stayed at their house for   days  On our plane ride home  we agreed going forward it would be better for our mental sanity to lodge separately from them   I ve kindly tried to explain to my boyfriend that it doesn t make sense for me to take time off work  spend money on a plane ticket and a dog sitter for us  to celebrate a high school graduation by camping in an RV park for   days    As a side note  my parents downplayed my own high school graduation  It was expected  not something to celebrate  And my dad was at the time very deep into his alcoholism and only showed up after it ended  I have a lot of feelings about all of this and when I explained to him that I would feel most comfortable in a hotel with a rental car so that we can visit  and then allow ourselves some time to breathe  I got several varying responses such as    I don t want to get a car and be a chauffeur for my family    You re making this all about you     This trip isn t about you U grumpyraccoon   it s literally just to go cheer for my niece because she s graduating and potentially meet some more of my family as a bonus  If you don t want to go along for the ride and meet some people and potentially get a lot of free meals out of the deal then you re right you shouldn t go   I think he is missing the point  I do want to go but I also want to be comfortable both mentally and physically  How do I explain to him that I can t foresee myself making that type of time and financial commitment unless he can make reasonable accommodations to make me feel safe and welcome  I am worried that not going will jeopardize the future of our relationship and I don t want to go on the trip with the mindset that I m just doing it to preserve my relationship    TLDR  my boyfriends  family reunion  is really to celebrate his nieces high school graduation and camp for   days  I hate camping  He doesn t want to budge  What do I do   Edit  for clarity on length of trip  Not sure if   or   days yet    would be my max lol
654,0,My Friend began Streaming on Twitch a month ago after her gaming friends got her into it and it s almost becoming her    priorityI m using a throwaway account because my main account is a name I use frequently across most my social media s and this is sorta sensitive    Anyway   Late last year my friend started playing games through steam and made a few friends through a game  She d spend a lot of time with these guys and it was never really problematic   She s been my closest friend for a long time now and I ve always been supportive of her   Fast forward to last month and she started streaming on twitch  Her first stream was art  and I was so proud of her for getting back out there and doing art  and doing it with an audience was even better because she needs all the positive support she can about her art   But then she started streaming her game with her friends  and she ll stream for hours  I was pretty supportive  even though she was streaming late at night when I m in bed so I couldn t really participate  and I began to feel very left out   Recently  I feel like it s been sort of taking over her life  When she s not working on schoolwork or doing housework  she s logged into steam playing her game or streaming it via twitch    The other night  she went from about  pm to  am nonstop    I know it s a new thing and she seems to be enjoying herself  but I almost feel like these other friends of hers and her twitch stream are becoming a priority to her  and I m left out because I am unable to play that game   Am I unreasonable feeling the way I do  
655,0,   Agendered  Having issues communicating with my partner    M Throwaway account because he knows my main       We ve been dating for a few months and it s been going very well  However  lately he s mentioned that he has issue with me not regularly contacting him  I m great at talking to people in person but when it comes to initiating phone calls  texts  or discord messages  I m not great at it  At the beginning of the relationship when we were getting to know each other  we talked all the time  However  I m having a stressful time at my job  and it leaves me emotionally  physically  and mentally exhausted  Overall he s been very supportive of me and we have discussions about what bother us  However  I ve explained to him how I struggle with communication that s not face to face  It s been a persistent issue in my life that all my friends and family say bother them  Tonight before he went to work  he mentioned it again       I just don t feel the need to constantly communicate with other people unless it s absolutely necessary  I ve talked to my therapist about this as well on and off between the other issues  depression  anxiety   GAD and social anxiety    and family issues  that I have  I  understand that when he sends me a message and I don t respond for a full day  he feels ignored  However  to me I don t know how to respond  For example he ll send me a meme at    pm on discord  he works overnights  I work days usually   pm to   pm  but sometimes I stay up late   I won t respond because I m playing a video game  usually civ  with no discord overlay and notification sounds turned off because they give me bad anxiety   By the time I see it  it s   am and I m ready to go to bed  I ve thought about just using emotes to respond but that feels very cheap to me  And at the end of it all  I enjoy having alone time when I m stressed after work      I want him to feel acknowledged  but our communication styles and frequency are very different  I don t want to develop the feeling that he s too clingy  but I fear I already am  He confesses that he needs a high level of communication  physical intimacy  and attention to be satisfied in a relationship  I just don t have as strong of a need in these areas as him  We ve talk about this  and I make it point to ask him if he s satisfied with the level of affection and attention I give him  He says that I m satisfying his needs  But if he feels the need to comment on it to me  I get the feeling otherwise       Ultimately it boils down to me that he consistently feels the need to share what s happening to him or around him where as I don t share as much  I especially don t feel like I have much to share when my job monopolizes my time and only leaves me feeling angry and upset  I don t always want to share that with him and he s expressed to me that he gets stressed hearing me talk about how my job makes me feel  In addition  I just don t feel the need to force myself to communicate when I have nothing to say  I understand social formality of checking in on people to make them feel like they matter  but I just have never cared for those things  I often feel forced to care about people s every issue when I m just not too preoccupied with the small details of their day  People tend to unload on me and ask me for advice  I m often too polite to ask them to just be quiet and let me talkI know that s my issue to deal with and I ve explain that to him  I m trying to work on that for all my relationships with my friends and family  I know it hurts them  I do care about them  I just don t care about how they don t like certain things at their workplace or how their hair isn t doing what they want for twenty minutes  I know I m asshole for that  but I get so stressed from people unloading on me that I ve just developed a habit of not even opening the door to communicating   I guess the question I m asking is this     How can I communicate with him without stressing myself out      Other notes   I m working on getting a new job that stresses me less and doesn t boil over into my relationships    I made a note to my therapist to help me with my lack of communication with the people who I care about  
656,0,Self Doubt FeelingsI have a crush on a guy  But im doubting myself and i told him about it  And he asked me if im sure that i like him  I said yes  But what about him  How do I know if he likes me too  
657,0,He still has a Tinder but said he deleted itI ve known him for a little over half a year    We both met during a time we weren t looking for anything serious  especially since he wasn t going to live in this state much longer  I was expecting to keep things light hearted and casual but he was very attentive and very persistent despite my efforts to keep distance between us  He wanted to talk all day  every day  He would often ask about my work schedule and make plans with me in advance  He d stop by after work if we had no time for plans  even if meant seeing me for a couple hours  It was honestly very sweet and different from the treatment I ve gotten in the past    There was a couple discussions about  us   and we agreed in the long run that a relationship is unrealistic due to the fact he wasn t going to stay in this state permanently and just overall life circumstances but we did express feelings for each other  I let him know I had deleted my dating profile and had no interest in seeking others and he was delighted  He also claimed he had no interest in seeking others  he enjoys what we have  and that he d delete his profile to make us happy    I thought we would just ride this out until the time came to say good bye  However  recently our schedules have been clashing and we hardly see each other  It was frustrating for a bit because he s not going to be here much longer  When we would hangout  I did notice he always looked at my phone if I had a call or notification  he looked through my social media friends  he would often text me if I was having a night out  he would watch me as I texted people  etc  He once even made a statement that if I were serious with someone else this whole time behind his back  he would stop seeing me    I thought after our discussions  it was implied that we weren t seeking others  The other day  I glanced at his phone randomly and I saw the tinder app  My heart sank  I didn t call him out because I was processing what I had just seen  Was I allowed to call him out  I m not his girlfriend  And I feel like shit because I ve respected what we had developed this whole time  I shut down guys who either wanted to come back into my life or wanted to get to know me  I never went out and flirted with strangers on a night out  Nothing  And I thought the treatment was mutual   The clock is ticking and he s leaving soon  And I m sad it s going to end knowing that I was deceived this whole time  I honestly thought he was different from all the other guys I have been involved with  I thought I knew what it felt like to be with someone who wasn t a piece of shit  I m    and at this point  I feel like giving up forever on relationships  I see all the couples around me and question if they are truly happy  I make up stories in my head that they are all just lying to each other  I have become very negative and can t focus on daily life    We have a date soon  The first real one in a couple months that we were both happy about  And now I don t even know if I should go through with it    Do I end this now  Should I even bother confronting  
658,0,Woman    F  taking man s    M  role Would it be seen as  weird  or  desperate  if I took on some of the traditional male roles in dating  Like I ask him out on dates  I text him  I ask if he wants to be official  all the things guys normally do with girls  What exactly makes these the male s roles  Almost all the reasons I ve heard for why women shouldn t ask men out are also applicable to men asking women out   To be clear  I don t mind being courted by men  but I happen to really like a guy who is pretty beta and doesn t make a lot of decisions for himself  he just goes along with what presents itself  His past girlfriends had all initiated the relationship  I ve known this guy a long while   I want to ask him out and  court  him  so to speak  but I m apprehensive because I was always taught that it s only the other way around  that women wait for them men to make all the moves and if a man is not making moves  he doesn t care and only desperate and or  crazy feminist  women  chase  men 
659,0,Am I      F  under appreciating my boyfriend     M  I don t want to make this awfully long  but I think that is something inevitable    I met my boyfriend in a live chat and within the first few weeks  I was hooked  I was in awe of him  my days felt lonely when we didn t talk and even then I used to stay up till   am to talk to him because he lives in Vienna   After couple of months  we started going out  LDR  and after some time I applied to university in Vienna and moved here  Needless to say  it was a very scary decision for me with a lot of financial  emotional and social burden   Before I moved  he was prepping for his medical entrance exam and he would still make sure we spend couple of hours talking  he would tell me he would learn cooking so I don t starve  would teach me how to speak german  would take me to places to see other cities  would make sure I always had him and in few years we would move in together    I was sold  I wanted to have a good education and moving to Vienna seemed like the best option  because he is like my family   And poor lad did everything for me  despite attending med school for the first year  from my bank account  to my residency visa  to skipping vacations with his family so we could spend time together  to going to doctors and fixing appointments for me  I m really thankful that I didn t have to figure that out for myself  because I hadn t faced the reality of being by myself before   Nevertheless  I can do almost everything by myself now and I even go by with broken german to communicate with people  However  he was subtly harsh in the beginning  I would go through homesickness phase and he would see situations like  I do everything for you so you can settle in  and all you do is hate on the city and say you want to go home   He would say I was weighing him down  and he feels like he is just there to take care of me while I wouldn t appreciate him enough    After   months  I stopped being a weepy mess and I made sure I was stable by myself  I tried to be liked by his friends  his family  made sure he feels like he doesn t have to be responsible for me  bought him little treats every time I went grocery shopping  made a ritual of making him breakfast every Sunday morning despite me learning to cook this past few months  I ve just emotionally invested myself in him too much and I really am happy in this relationship   However  I can t help but think I put more effort than him  and whenever I bring this up  he says it s because I m lonely and I have no one but him so it feels like I invest more than him  while he has his uni and his family here  And I read posts here  I feel the emptiness  He never buys flowers for me  nor opens doors for me and never really compliments me    I threw a fit in Valentines day saying I want to celebrate it and his response was  Shouldn t us being together matter more  We could just watch a movie   He s right  but I can t help but want the physical gestures  I get him flowers at times  treat him out to lunch  hang out with him in the library because he is always studying  wait on him so we could go back home together  But he only does things when I ask him to and worse is when I have to convince him to do things   Am I being unreasonable or expecting too much  I just want simple thoughtful things  like showing up so we could have lunch together  wearing those jeans because I complimented him  making time that fits my schedule as well just because he wants to talk to me  needing me as a person  Not just having someone right here with him    I moved here  so we could have a future together  work things out long term and I am certain he wants that as well  and when I communicate with him about not feeling needed  he backs it up saying he is barely floating by with things  while I am only drowning him  Is there something I could do that won t make him feel like he is being burdened  And is there some say I can stop feeling like this     TL DR   Boyfriend isn t a gesture based guy  while I am and I think its making me believe that I put more effort into our relationship  Is there something I could do so things feel content without him having to feel like I m burdening him 
660,0,My    M  girlfriend    F  tested if I would cheat on her with her friend    F  and I feel conflicted I feel very weird right now  Been together with my girlfriend for a year and a half right now  Everything has been going pretty well between us  and I saw no reason for her to do this which is why it hurts me even more  We were talking about moving in together and this has created some doubt with me   I do have to mention that she has been cheated on in both of her previous relationships  On top of that they were emotionally abusive towards her  so we had some issues in the beginning but I supported her and  I thought  we were past that already  She was hurt pretty badly by those people and she s been seeing a therapist after I encouraged her   This all went down last night  Me  my girlfriend and her friend  let s say L  all go to the same college and we had the day off today  So last night I went over to my girlfriend s place to watch a movie and L was going to be there too  I know her as my girlfriend s friend and that s it  I get there and that s when my girlfriend says she s going to the store to grab some snacks and will be back in    min  I m just on my phone looking for a good movie that s on Netflix when L stood up and sat next to me  I thought this was weird but I was pretty invested in finding a movie lol  so I brushed it off   Basically she started touching my arms and my leg and I got uncomfortable  I asked her what she was doing and she said nothing  I told her to stop and that s when she left for the bathroom and came back in her underwear  Again I asked her wtf she was doing and she sat on my lap and kissed me  and I pushed her off me  I m pissed at this point and L can tell  and she calls for my girlfriend  She comes in and L tells her I didn t try anything  I put two and two together and got pretty upset  asked my girlfriend why she would do this to me  She started to apologize and broke down in tears  saying she s sorry and that she didn t know why she did this   I left because I was very stressed and not thinking clearly  and I didn t want to do or say anything stupid  I got a long heartfelt text from my girlfriend that night and this morning  It s again how sorry she is and that she wishes she could turn back time and that she loves me  I told her it was fine  but that I didn t like what she did at ALL  I asked to talk to her tonight  and she agreed  I feel like I need to talk to her about how and why it had to come to this  I feel a little bit hurt that she still doesn t entirely trust me after all this time  I get that she has a rough history and a lot of trust and insecurity issues  but I have feelings too you know    amp  x   B   How do I talk to her about this  I m hurt  but I do want to work things out with her  In every other aspect she s perfect to me  we were talking about moving in together for a reason  I can tell that she s genuinely sorry and regrets her actions  but still 
661,0,Girlfriend    f  and I    m  are finished  but unsure of what to do  Am I the bad guy for not providing the support Hello everyone  My girlfriend and I met around   years ago  We now have a  yr old son together  She cheated on me in July of       We split shortly after that but got back together in late      early         At the time we separated  she had just finished school and was offered a good paying job  Up until that point  I was paying for all housing expenses involving our son  rent and everything else  During those years before she graduated  I had started using credit cards more and more just to keep afloat  The plan was  when my then fianc e graduated and started working  we would both tackle the credit cards  Well  things didn t exactly go this way    In very late      early      we decided to reconcile  I felt that because we have a son together  and also because I still loved her  I was willing to give the relationship a second chance  But  I also let her know that she s got a lot of work to do in order to rebuild trust  She agreed and we moved forward    About two months ago I could sense things weren t right between us  I felt she was drifting away and wanting more and more space  It was a reminder of how things were back before her affair in         We are now separated  still living together  separate rooms  because we are in a lease and neither can afford to move  The separation was basically mutual  I couldn t handle her depression and anxiety and alcoholism  Not only that but  last year she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as well  It s just too much to handle    I decided to not burden any of my friends with my relationship problems  so instead turned to my mother for advice    Basically my mother said I needed to provide all the continual support my now ex needs so that she can seek the help she needs with all of her mental illness and her drinking problem  I told my mom that I just can t do it anymore  Back when we got back together  I found I was the one putting in all the effort  It was like it was ME that had the affair instead of her  I brought this up several times  and it s basically what led up to us separating again  My ex basically said she can t be that loving person I need  She couldn t be that affectionate  intimate significant other I needed    Now my mother  she basically says it s not really her fault  affair and separation  because she s got so many mental issues  and if I walk away without fighting for the relationship  then I can t walk away with a clear conscience  So we argued back and forth  I basically told my mom that there isn t an excuse for an affair  There isn t an excuse to treat your significant other like crap  especially when that significant other has done everything in their power to keep the family alive while the other half did below the bare minimum    So yea  my mother thinks I m an asshole for wanting to call it quits  She even told me to  grow up  and provide the support  I m sorry but  for years and years I have been dragged through the mud with my ex  I just can t continue doing this anymore  But  it s frustrating when my own family calls me unsupportive because I am turning my back on the mother of my son when she is in need  Sorry but  I have done all I could  My cup is empty and I cannot continue to be my ex s caretaker any longer    So here I am  I don t think I m questioning my choice to leave  rather  I m questioning whether or not I made the right decision to continue to provide support or just sit back and watch my ex self destruct    Thoughts  Am a piece of crap for this   Edit  wanted to add that my mother sided with my ex because she too suffers depression and says she knows what it s like

664,0,I m just confused about my relationship and not sure if I m going through middle age crisis    Sorry for the long post and typos       My fiance    m  and I    F  have been together for six years  engaged for about a year  We are both divorced once and he has three kids which we have     custody and kids live with us     of the time  We both work long hours and live comfortably    I get a lot of mixed feeling living with my fiance  who I will call  Mark   over the last couple of years  Mark didn t really had that many girlfriend as he married the first one  his EX  and met me on Tinder shortly after his divorce  He had problems with dead bedroom in his past marriage similar to me  so we both felt sexually compatible with high sex drive    I met Mark s kids six months after dating him  I love the kids very much and surprisingly kids and I have a fairly good relationship    I grew up in a very deciplined home  similar to Mark  However  kids  mom is not providing much deciplines in their life  and I feel it s all up to us to teach them manner and skills in their life which I find exuhsting something and it was one of the primarily reasons for our fight in the first few years of our relationship  Kids  two teenager and   years old  are not trained to pick up after themselves or provide help around the house here and there  This has caused us constantly picking up after them as we both like a clean and tidy house which seems to be an strange concepts to the kids  Simple request to tidy up their room every week before going back to mom is not reasonable to them and they usually do a half ass job when we insist  It s been very hard for me to deal with these type of issues as they don t contribute to the house  Since Mark left his past marriage for lack of sexual compatibility with his ex  he feel guilty about that and always try to overcompensate with kids and not really pushing the kids to do what is expected of them in terms of chiores and kids living     with Mom in a non deciplined house doesn t help the situation  He is afraid that kids could decide to live with their Mon if he push them too hard  To keep me happy he always pick up their slack and clean after them which makes me feel guilty as he works hard and long hours    I have came to the point of my life that I think the only thing he enjoys doing with me is sex and hanging out with kids  We don t do much when the kids are not around other than sex and smoking weeds  When the kids are around  we are full on with their activities and their school related stuff  not to mention Mark travel every other month when it s not kids week    We have been filghting quite a bit over the same similar matters     kids related stuff  trying to get Mark do what it s right for the kids  and teaching them skills the should have had by this age rather than mothering them  call it tough love    Sex related stuff  considering he haven t had the chance to explore his sexually due to lack of confidence in the past  he is into kinky stuff like threesome  mmf   which I have not much interest in  but I have done it for him couple of times and will not be doing it again for him as it will be damaging our relationship   Having trust issue because shortly after our engagement I found out that he is an exhibitist who likes to go on webcams and show things that is totally against my principal even tough he was anonymous  He hasn t done it since but  to be honest I m tired of trying to find out what he is up to and try to bust him  I feel I don t care and I just want him to do it again so I have the strength to walk away no matter what     He is smart and knows how to cover his track and I can t trust him with internet which is every where  he cleared his last hour of browsing sometimes and he thinks I don t know that     You see  I m all fucked up  Feel like a second citizen when he ALWAYS schedule s his business trips on my weeks and never on kids week    Mark and I are both attractive and financially stable and probably can find someone if we are not together  I love him very much and I geniusly think he loves me and his kid and family likes me too  But with all the problems that we ve encountered over the last few years and me threatening to leave and he proposing to me  is giving me doubt whether or not we can be happy together in a long run  I feel he is settling for me because of stability in his sexlife  kids attachment to me  and his family liking our relationship in general  He has these reasons to stay with me and none of them is what I quite want  I wanted him to wants me and want to have a baby with me which is kind of getting late for me to have and I would have had it before hitting     BTW  he had shown interest in making baby with me recently but I have kind of lost interest  I don t really know how to feel sometimes and smoking week help me calm myself and not be as uptight  I really hate that I can t trust him anymore  I hate that I pick up the fight when he put too much of his energy into his kids and only consider my feeling s when I m frustrated with it  I feel aweful asking for his time when he has stretched himself too thin  I don t feel good when I want him to get the kids to do their choirs and stand his ground and often end up fighting with him  I feel bad that he feels empty when kids are not with him and I want him to myself on those week  I feel bad to ask him to schedule his business trip not only on my weeks      I love his kids very much     Stuck between a rock and a hard place  I can t walk out and come back because there are kids involved  when I leave I have to be sure there is no coming back beside we got engaged a year ago         I m just confused about my relationship and not sure if I m going through middle age crisis     Am I   
665,0,My    F  boyfriend    M  told me if I keep turning him down when he tries to have sex with me he s going to do it anyway and that he won t feel bad about it  Not sure where to go from hereWe ve been together for about   years  I always thought we had a pretty average sex life  Recently it s been less than normal but I m exhausted from being overworked and honestly when I have extra time I just want to go to bed    I don t know what to make of his comment  Especially since he knows I was a victim of sexual assault    He left for work right after making that comment so I haven t talked to him about it  I don t know what to say when he gets home  I don t know what to do    Edit  throwaway for obvious reasons

668,0,Just another question about relationships i guessTo start things i am a    year old guy  About six months ago i started working in a retirement home and for the first   months i was a  new guy  and didnt hang out with others outside of work  After those   months our firm held a new year party  now on the party i talked with couple of colleagues and i made friends with who i was and still am friends outside of work  One group of people stood out and we were after that and still are great friends  in that gropu    of us one guy   girls and me  there is one girl who stood out to me in particular  Lets call her Ann and she is    years old  After that party Ann and i started texting one another and since than i think that not a day has passed without us talking with each other  There were couple of times when we were drunk that we made out and a couple of times that we made out sober  nobody knows that we made out   As you probably figured it out i fell in love with her and despite us making out i am not sure that she would want a relationship with me  I want to tell her everything and see if she feels something for me but i am afraid that if she doesnt feel the same it would ruin our relationship as friends  The question i have is do you guys think that me confessing everything to her is going to ruin our friendship if she doesnt feel the same

671,0,My  M    ex    F  is about to enter an unhappy marriage  I never stopped loving her  and I m seriously considering to stop the wedding I m M    When I was     I met this wonderful girl  F    and I fell in love pretty much instantly  I wouldn t think she d be interested in me since I m the epitome of social awkwardness  but somehow I managed to make her notice me and to EVERYONE S surprise we started dating  I always knew she wasn t into me as much as I was  and my insecurities ended up fucking it up  Long story short  we ended up breaking up after two months   Fast forward to last August  we stumbled upon each other and she looked very happy to see me  Needless to say I hadn t felt this happy in years  She was very willing to  catch up  and she even told me that she had recently found a box with all the letters I used to give her  I d give her a letter and a flower every morning before class   I wouldn t think she d have kept them but that made me think that I might still have a chance    She said she thought I m a very sweet person and she regrets that we didn t remain friends  This was all going very well until she asked me if I m seeing anyone  I thought she d asked to see if I m single  but then she said that she s engaged  she wasn t wearing a ring   and she s getting married next year   Maybe I m stupid  or completely in love  but I chose to give it a try anyway  We started spending time together  mostly not just the two of us  her friends or her boyfriend would be there too   I don t know how I found the courage  but a few days ago I finally told her    I gave her a letter I wrote for her  telling her I never stopped loving her and I know she feels the same because of the amount of time she spends with me and everything that is untold between us  I even ended the letter with an invitation for a weekend excursion  just me and her  to see if we still  feel it    The reaction wasn t good  She ended up crying  saying that I had  misunderstood   that she only saw me as a friend  that she d made it clear from the beginning that she was engaged  still no ring   and that she didn t think I d still feel the same after    years  I tried to hug her but she didn t let me  Not only she left  but she told her boyfriend about it too  I know because he deleted me on FB   I know  heroic acts  look good in movies but end up bad in real life  but I ve been seriously considering to stop the wedding  Why would she cry if it was a misunderstanding  Why would she be spending so much time with me if she loved someone else  How can she like being engaged if she never wears her ring  Why did she keep all my letters    Do I let her make a big mistake  do I do the brave thing  or will I end up making a big mistake myself  What should I do  Should I talk to her  Should I just wait and hope that she realises how wrong this is  What should I do 
672,0,I feel as if my relationship is not progressing and I don t know what to do from here and if I should move onI f  student  have been with my boyfriend for about two years  I love him with all my heart but I am starting to feel like he isn t enough and that the relationship isn t going anywhere  We have a long distance relationship and I almost never see him  We love each other but are both busy people and don t have enough time to keep up communication  It s not that that s exclusive to him  I rarely call my mom either  but a relationship should be different  I really do love him and he loves me too  but I don t know if I should move on  because I don t feel like the relationship is progressing  It s more like we love each other but never actually get to be there for each other  Any advice is appreciated 
673,0,My group of friends  M     F   x  and me  M    have an annoying friend and we don t know what to doI don t know if this belongs here but this is a relationship by definition so here goes  so   years ago we became acquainted with this shy girl  let s call her Drama Queen  DQ   that didn t really fit in anywhere but seemed nice on the surface so we ended up befriending her and we got closer until she was officially a  part  of the group   So fast forward to     years ago  DQ got together with this guy  let s call him HealthMan  HM   This is when things started to go downhill  Drama Queen didn t really talk much before  but she became a chatterbox with the one and only subject being  HealthMan  It was suffocating  she was breathing HealthMan  eating HealthMan  hell  she probably shat HealthMan too  We endured it because well  it was just a phase or something  we thought it would fade away after a while  Well  since she was stuck in her HealthMan craze we got closer leaving Drama Queen and HealthMan behind  because    well    DQ didn t really talk about anything else  we couldn t talk to them about anything  it was just DQ and HM  It s worth noting that she is an attention seeker  she does anything for attention and that is probably why she explained every action she did with HM in disturbingly niche details     months ago  HM broke up with DQ for soon to be obvious reasons  If it wasn t clear enough she was kinda crazy   DQ went into a depression  but don t worry  she was still living the HM life  talking about him nonstop  Even water made her think of her knight in shining armor  HM  Since he didn t want to be anywhere near DQ  he drifted away from our friend group  leaving us to deal with the one and only Drama Queen  There was a bunch of drama for no reason over the   following months  team assignments with both DQ and HM  we had to put up with it because she was still our  friend   Basically there was no Drama Queen without drama  they come hand in hand  I can t put all the stories on here cause it wouldn t end  but she threw tantrums over the smallest details  We attempted to seek help from the school counselor  but the situation remained the same  She was still the one  the only  Drama Queen   We have spoken a lot about what to do about this  she was clearly an overreacting piece of work  even though she does have mental troubles  it doesn t justify this level of disturbance  We want to kick her out of the group but at the same time we don t want drama to happen all over again as she literally stood in front of HM s parent s car to talk about the why he left her even though he explained over and over and the answer was not going to change because she asked again   A couple weeks ago  she found her new attention machine  HockeyPlayer  Now  she is closer to the two girls than to me and we are more than fed up with her clearly unchanging conversations and drama  These gals are faking the friendship as they have had enough to say they aren t friends anymore but they don t want to start drama or be assholes  I was once in the same situation but after a while I started to ignore her and she stopped bothering me  but the girls can t as she is stickier than glue  They have said that DQ is breathing HockeyPlayer  eating HockeyPlayer and probably defecating the dude as well  They said she thinks she is better than them as she has a boyfriend and they do not   We are lost  we don t know what to do  should we just be honest and tell her the hard truth  It will definitely end badly if we do that but we are honestly considering it  Should we just endure her the for the next year and a half until we never have to talk to her again since we will graduate  If you have any suggestions  please  tell me

680,0,My mental health is fucking up my relationship and Idk what to doTL DR at the end   So my gf and I have been dating for nearly   years now  Our relationship has always been very wholesome and amazing and we generally fight very little  But recently I think it s going downhill   So I have mental problems  I haven t been diagnosed with anything in particular because I was never in permanent therapy  Irish mental health sector is a fucking mess  but it s something along the lines of anxiety and chronic stress along with some form of possibly manic depression  Not fun but whatever  It s not the worst ever like I m lucky in that I m relatively high functioning    However it affects my gf big time  I used to frequently confide in her with my problems and admittedly it was highly toxic as i was using her as a target of sorts at the time  We discussed this and I of course apologised and stuff and I decided to seriously look at myself and how I m affecting people around me  I have kept her at arms length now in terms of how I m doing and she has always been very understanding but very clear that she s affected by my breakdowns and whatnot which I was fine with   So this was okay until recently  She went on an exchange trip the other week and to me she seemed really distant  Like she was obviously very busy but when we texted she never told me how she was getting on  And I tried to bring it up and it erupted into a massive argument  She said she didn t want to talk to me while she was away because she actually wanted to enjoy herself and I put a damper on her day because I m always going on about how I m feeling and stuff  That s a very general summary but thats the gist   So I ve been feeling terrible about it  I feel like it came out of nowhere  My mental state HAS been deteriorating but I was still doing the best I could to not tell her too much about it at all  And I feel like now I m just a burden to her  Like I m not the person she loves anymore  She feels like I m a chore to deal with  It s unbearable because I can t give out to her for what she s feeling because it s valid but at the same time I feel horrific about it all  Like I keep thinking if she  the person who is supposed to love me more than most  thinks I m a burden  then everybody must think I m a chore to deal with    I don t know what to do  We ve been talking since but it s not the same  She s completely cold  She s still annoyed with me and she s not letting me in at all  I feel completely trapped  And idk what to do  Any help is appreciated greatly   TL DR  Gf and I had an argument  she says I put a damper on her day  I now feel like I m a complete burden on her and I m destroying the relationship  Can i do anything   
681,0,Seems like me     m  and s o     f  are not clickingYes I know we are young  that doesn t disqualify me from seeking advice    I don t know where to start so I ll just jump into it  I ve known her since we were both in high school  Nothing became serious until I graduated and she was a senior  We dated for roughly a year and a half until she broke up with me  was completely my fault     During our relationship everything was great aside from fights that were few and far between  We spent time together  did stuff together  went on vacation together  sex was not hard to come by with her  All in all it was a good relationship    After we broke up she started talking to seeing this guy from her work     m   There was a very small gap in between our relationship and this fling  During this  fling  we would still talk regularly as it is hard to just completely cut someone out of your life that you ve talked to literally everyday  This included me trying to get her back  All the while I suspected this guy was using her for sex  She would go to his house very late at night  I only know this because I would be ignored while she was there  On the rare occasion that I got to see her she would constantly be texting him and snap chatting him    I should also mention that this guy was interested in her while we were dating but was turned down because we were together  He some how managed to get her number and the first time he ever texted her was while he was drunk and asking her to come over  doesn t seem like a very great impression to make    This fling lasted from about       to the middle of       After it gradually ended she seemed genuinely interested in attempting to fix us  I am all for that and realized my mistakes and what I did wrong and am doing my best to make her happy  while it s hard to make myself happy at the same time    That brings us to now  and the current issues     it doesn t seem like she wants to put forth any effort at all    it seems like she is always on her phone but doesn t respond to me a lot  I don t expect her to constantly text me all day but it s nice to hear from her on her breaks at work     she is not interested in being intimate with me at all aside from the occasional peck on the lips  now I don t want to sound like an asshole  but to me the only thing that keeps a relationship different from a friendship is the sex aspect  I don t expect to have sex all the time but there has been literally nothing  no touching  kissing   keep in mind she was going to his guys house and just having sex with him      she constantly asks for back rubs and when I rarely ask for her to scratch my back in return she gets extremely mad and accuses me of trying to fight with her and she says  this is why I broke up with you in the first place   I find it weird as hell why she would get mad at me for asking  I feel like I have my life together  I live on my own  have a decent paying labor intensive job  I have plans to better myself for the future  I feel like I m driven  I have goals  Is there something I can do to make her put forth a little more effort  Should I just cut my losses now before I get heartbroken a second time  Should I wait it out and see if she tries just a fucking little bit harder   Thanks for anyone who replies
682,0,Second day after a breakup  and I want her back Hi y all    days ago me and my girlfriend of a few months ended our relationship on an amicable note  There were no arguments  no quarrels  no distancing  We are starting college in August and we were on the same page about splitting up sometime before we left  But the other day  almost out of the blue  I say almost because the week before she had been distressed while receiving her admission decisions  she says that we should end it  She said she didn t want to get too attached before being ripped away from someone again  she had a similar experience a couple years ago    Long story short  I m not really happy with this outcome  I still see her every day in school  and I m still shell shocked that our relationship went from full swing to absolutely nothing so quickly  I want her back  but have no clue if I should initiate that conversation with her  Even if we couldn t get back together I d like to be upfront with her about how I m feeling about the breakup because so far I ve been mum about how I really feel  rather just agreeing with her to make it a little easier  That was a stupid decision  I know now  As soon as possible I d like to take her out to lunch or something and discuss  So reddit  Am I dwelling too much on this  Or should I try to salvage the relationship

685,0,I    M  need advice about sex frequencyHello people of reddit  I am a   m  who is currently on a break with a   f  We dated for about a year and a half  before she told me she need time to herself to sort out some personal stuff  Fine with me    One the issues we had been juggling for a while was the frequency of sex  She says she wanted it only a couple times a month  while I said I wanted it at least once a week  In addition  recently we ve had a lot of issues finding places to do it  as both our dormmates are recluses and never leave  We also didn t have hardly any money or cars to go anywhere  Not sure if it s an excuse  just thought I d give extra details  as to say we only were able to do it about once a month anyways    I guess my question is how much do you all think is enough for an otherwise healthy couple  How many times in a month do you all have sex  Any advice is great   Cheers  
686,0,I    F  can t tell if I actually like this girl    F  back or not Yeah so this might be extremely stupid    So I ve had very few romantic relationships  Being gay  it s hard finding girls who like you back and are your type also  So most of my feelings have been directed towards straight girls who I could never have    A girl that I find insanely attractive recently admit that she had feelings for me for a while  From what I can tell  she s very very into me  I would even say obsessive    So I was like  you know what  I think she s attractive  she s fun to talk to  let s see where this goes    And the first week or so of talking I was super into her  I couldn t stop thinking about her  I always wanted to be with her  I was sure I wanted something with her    It s been a little while since then  and I almost feel nothing for her  I can t tell if it s because I m stressed with school and lacrosse  or if it s because I just ain t into her anymore    When we hang out  I get all of those old feelings back however  I get excited to see her  I want to cuddle and do  other things  But when I m not with her or just through text I feel nothing for her    For example  she s coming to my house today and I m excited for that  But I m texting her right now and it just is boring asf    I know I m not lonely  I was actually at a time in my life where I wasn t lonely and dying for someone to come into my life for once  I was very good with myself    I just don t know what I m feeling or not feeling  
687,0,I m     F  starting to lose interest in my bf of   months     M   We live together and have a baby on the way  I just wanna start off by saying I appreciate the advice I m gonna receive but if I have an opinion on it don t get offended  We re all entitled to our opinions   Anyways I just want to say that I love my boyfriend unconditionally  We had a talk yesterday and ever since that I been thinking a lot about it  The talk began with him telling me he wants a more fun relationship  I ask him to be more specific and he explains that he wants to do more things together   I take what he says into account but also I explain to him some concerns I had as well  Like him not being affectionate enough for me  Now I m a hopeless romantic  I don t expect him to shower me with rose petals or anything over the top  and I feel like I try to be the most romantic out of the both of us  He rarely wants to cuddle with me  spend time with me even if we re just in the house  and doesn t even want to have sex most of the time  he ll constantly go on porn which I thought nothing of at first but he watches it more then I d like him to   Now I don t expect these things to be an everyday       thing but I m sure most girls love getting attention   Now he claims that I never take his feelings into account but honestly I try to  Maybe not in the way he feels I should but I do  When he talked about things he wanted us to do I literally told him to just pick some things he wanted us to do and his next off days we can do them  He complains about having to  choose  everything but I asked him because I m just trying to understand where he s coming from  Now as far as me wanting more affection     As I said I told him I wanted him to be more affectionate  He said since we re already   months in it we should be over the whole  cupcake stage    We dated online for about   months before I moved in with him  I feel like since we ve never gotten to be around each other during those months I haven t got to experience most of that in person but just through texts and video chats  This is my first real relationship and the first time I been in love but for him I believe I m his second love  He feels like since he s been through this before with other relationships that he s over it   I don t think that s fair to my feelings and I try to be considerate of his feelings whether he realizes it or not but I honestly don t feel that same respect  As I said I love him deeply and I want things to work out not even because we re going to have a child together but because we connected more then I have with any other person  But ever since that talk I ve come to realize that he may not be who I thought he was  I want someone to be just as equally romantic as me and maybe I have high expectations but I see couples that s been together longer then us showing each other more affection all the time  It really upsets me and I feel my feelings slowly starting to fade away   Is wanting affection so wrong  I m gonna have a talk with him about how I feel but I just wanted some input

692,0,M     and F     broke up  I slept with another girl  then with F      other girl has chlamydia  What do I do Me and F broke up for a bunch of reasons  Mainly we think it was just a bad time in life  Stress with family  education  finances  which ultimately impacted our romantic life  heightened my anxiety which made me crazy paranoid at times  and so on       So we ve been broken up for like    months  but since the relationship was going down hill for a while  we both agree it feels more like    Anyways during this lull  I was speaking with a girl  who I told I was tested  amp  was clean  true   she said she was also clean       A few weeks later  F gets in contact  she s living local again  I suggest hanging out  and we have the most amazing weekend of sex and hanging out  Like before the relationship got fucked up  So  obviously we re both pretty smitten and feeling that buzz again  and tbh  i don t want it to stop       This other girl messages me saying she s been tested and chlamydia has came up positive  I should go get some medication and get checked fully just to be safe  Good on her for telling me  and tbh  placebo or not  my manhood is seeming a little sore now she s mentioned it      But now I have to mention it to F  We did not use protection  so she might have it  We still have some issues to overcome  even if we decide to just be friends  even that would be better than never seeing her  she was a great friend first for a long time  and I have missed being able to confide in her  the sex was just a bonus to it all   But I don t want telling her to fuck up whatever could happen      Idk if she wants to get back together  or keep doing what we re doing to see what happens or where it goes  or if it was just friends fucking  and nothing more  But even so  I d like to keep that friend  or take it further if she wanted to  but I m worried this is going to rip any chance away the second I tell her

698,0,I    F  don t know how to deal with my father anymore     For as long as I can remember  my father has demolished my self esteem  He ll preface his lectures with  I m not trying to insult you  before proceeding to insult me for the next       minutes   You re a failure to me  I never expected you to turn out like this  is one of his favourites   When you have kids  I hope they hate you  And they will    I have to lie to my friends when they ask about you because you re a disappointment    You re a woman  you should be running the house  Paying the bills  Doing all the house work  Studying and working    You never follow through on anything you commit to    this is about the fact that I was supposed to spend two years interstate finishing my post grad but deferred after the first year due to a suicide attempt   Your friends are more successful than you    You ll spend your life in bed and your husband and children will hate you    Are you really that weak and pathetic to try to kill yourself    Why are you cutting yourself when I ve given you everything you could ever ask for   He ll pick apart every mistake I made in my life   that car accident back in       Not attending school in       Lying to him in       Stopping gym in        I developed severe depression and anxiety as a teenager because I d be too scared to leave my room which has bled well into my adult years  I d spend hours avoiding him by staring at my ceiling and hoping I could escape  My ceiling quickly became a trigger for severe panic attacks  As did his voice  Till this day  whenever I hear him yell at my brother or talk loudly on the phone  I feel the fear of a child who s terrified of a monster under their bed  I have some serious insomnia and anxiety that makes it impossible to sleep sometimes  added to my depression and I can be bed ridden for weeks  Time is wasted  I ll never get it back  I ve heard this growing up hundreds of times and it never fails to break me  I feel like everything he says is true even though I m a post grad student in a stable relationship  planning to move to the US   He s even tried to break that up  claiming my boyfriend deserves better than me  He s expressed fear that my atheist boyfriend might be masking as a Muslim man trying to lure me into converting into Islam because of a Facebook video he watched      He does this in the name of being a good father   Stay in Australia    Run this house    Prove to me you can be a good daughter    Stop making me worry    Change yourself   Anyone with mental health issues knows how hard it is to build themselves up and how easily you can crumble and fall     years of hearing to the same old song  it s a muddled mess of  Is he right   or  Is he a major dickhead   
699,0,I    F  have been in a relationship of   years with my boyfriend    M  who still lives with his momI don t know what to do  He has never lived outside of his house or with somebody else  His parents are divorced and he is mentally abused used by his mom  Recently he went on a trip with his mum which I wasnt invited to because his mom wanted me to take care of her cats  This hurt me so much that he couldn t step up for his own rights and accepted to go on a trip with her even though we had a big fight about this and he told me that he wont go but still he went  Nowadays he is depressed because of work  his relationships with everybody  and I told him many times to move out of his house with me because he will become much better mentally emotionally but as I see it he says he wants to but wont do anything to really prove it  He doesnt have meaningfull friendships besides me  I live in a rent    minutes away from his home and he would rather make me go to his place where his mother is  because it s more comfortable there for him  than him coming to my place where we are only the two of us   Besides the mommy boy traits he is financially independent  putting money away and working out  
700,0,Can t stand to be around BFSo me      and my bf       have been dating for   months now  We started dating right after I ended a long term relationship of   years  my ex cheated on me  It was really great in the beginning  I felt I really loved him  He treats me really well  better than any person I ever dated  Over time I ve gotten annoyed of him sometimes but now I can t stand to be near him or see him  I don t know what happened  He is very emotional  cries a lot esp if he thinks we are breaking up  and early in our relationship would beg me not to leave him  I feel like I am his life he does nothing but wait for me and work  he doesn t really have friends  I feel like a bad person when I m with him because he s so sweet yet I despise him now  I told him i felt suffocated and didn t know if we could make it  he told me maybe I am self destructing this relationship because I feel I don t deserve to be loved after having been cheated on   I don t know what to do  maybe he is right  I ve never gone from loving someone so much to dreading seeing them or getting a text from them  
701,0,My GF    F  and I    M  planning on moving in together but I can t with her dog Sorry for the long post but it is a complicated situation  A little background  I moved to a new city and within the first month found this woman and we have had a strong connection almost immediately  Everything is good about the relationship we get along very well and communicate very well when issues arise  We have already talked some about this dilemma  We are tentatively planning on her moving into my apartment in about   months  We both think this is a great idea and a necessary step because I am a young Engineer and don t plan on staying at my current job any longer then I have to  My lease will have   months left on it so it s the perfect opportunity to see if we are living compatible before potentially moving elsewhere  We have a very strong bond and we both can see a great future with each other  I have a   year old lab puppy  He is very calm and very well behaved because I have spent months training him after graduating college  The major dilemma we have talked about is her    month old Pitbull puppy   Her dog is VERY high energy  destroys everything in its path  has separation anxiety and constantly breaks out of its crate and destroys stuff  Doesn t behave around other dogs its alright around mine but plays too rough and won t stop when my boy is exhausted   Her dog is somewhat potty trained but will still go inside out of spite when it is not receiving attention   The dog will not stay in a crate for a work day and has torn up the floor  lots of her clothes  and just about anything it can  She also currently has a roommate that doesn t work and looks after the dog during the day because it cannot stay in its crate  One solution she was okay with was giving the dog to the roommate  but he doesn t want it because it is too much to deal with  I have said that I will help her train her dog    but I do not think it is possible in the   short months we have  I also don t think long term I am able to deal with the amount of energy it has  I like my home to be a place of relaxation not WILD uncontrollable energy  I have sort of gave her the ultimatum that the dog either must calm down and be better trained  probably not possible  or she will have to get rid of it if she plans on living with me   She also currently knows that if she were living on her own that she would not be able to handle to dog  I suggested that if she wants to keep the dog that she can get her own place to live   but that is limiting because she will be locked in there for a year  while I don t plan on staying at my job that long  She understands this dilemma   She also has a career that is very flexible and can get a job just about anywhere  I m looking for advice or recommendations on possible solutions or to see if I m being an a  hole for essentially saying me or the dog  She knows how bad her dog is and how much energy it has and has acknowledged that it is too much  but she is a caring soul and  committed  to the dog when she got it and thinks it is unfair to the dog to rehome it   
702,0,Is non physical cheating worth ending my    f  relationship with my partner    f  over  At what point does trying to make it work become unhealthy So  this is my first time posting  obviously a throw away account since my partner knows my username  so I m sorry if the format is weird   My partner and I have been together for about two years now and have had problems with trust lying before  She s lied about some things that happened with her ex at the beginning of our relationship  no physical cheating that I know of  but basically just shady shit like talking to her constantly but not telling her that she was dating me for like  months  etc   and I only found out about these things accidentally  and basically had to force the truth out of her    I know this makes ME a bad girlfriend  but I felt like I was going crazy about not trusting her when she was denying everything  so just a few months ago  I looked through her phone  I know this alone is enough proof that there is no trust in our relationship  but I couldn t let her keep making me feel like I was crazy and imagining things  When I looked at her phone I of course found things that I didn t want to see  messages with her ex proving some of my suspicions were true  messages over social media flirting with coworkers and camgirls  note  I don t judge sexworkers or anyone else for my girlfriend s shitty behavior   After I found all of this  I knew I can t go crazy over just flirting  and I also came to the conclusion that since we never discussed boundaries regarding porn  ie if we re okay with each other watching or talking to camgirls   I can t exactly call that cheating  although friending them and flirting over social media is definitely crossing a line  So  I asked her to sit down so we can have another talk about boundaries  and we agreed that chatting with camgirls is cheating in our relationship  she never admitted that she did so and even went so far as to say she wouldn t even be interested in doing that   and that we also agree that soliciting paid or unpaid nudes from people would fall under cheating  Although I still felt cheated and upset  I decided to just work on the relationship and move forward with a clean slate   Recently I began to feel like she was being shady again  so I again did the terrible thing of looking through her phone  This time  I found her secret reddit that she uses exclusively for porn  no judgement on that   but then I saw the messages from her soliciting and paying for pics and vids from girls within literally the last   weeks  and with the same camgirl from before  which is way after our conversation  I texted her asking if she would ever cheat on me  including just sending or receiving nudes  and she said that she would never  and said that people who did that were shitheads     My question is  how should I even go about this  We live together and finances are pretty tight so I m anxious about having to pay to break the lease  but I don t know if this is something we can work through  Is there a way to even talk to her about this without letting her know I went through her phone  I feel so lost and I have no idea where to even start    amp  x   B   TL DR my girlfriend solicited paid for nudes even after agreeing that doing so would be considered cheating in our relationship  is this worth trying to fix the relationship or should I finally end it 
703,0,my girlfriend plans to move out secretly  I dont know what to do my gf moved in me     years ago but her family doesnt know this  living together before marriage is not totally accepted here in my country  her family know me and our relationship  They think their girl live in the uni dorm and they pay for the school for that   my family knows and ok with this living together situation   Her mother will come to our city to see her for the first time  my gf got anxious suddenly  I told her it is okey we will move her belongings to dorm room for this visit  her mother may stay at our home   but then she started having anxiety attacks saying lying to her family is bad  making her dad pay for the dorm is a betrayal since they barely can pay it   I pay the full rent and expenses of our home I have a good job of my own and this expenses not a real problem   I tried telling her either way her family will pay for the dorm or shared student home  It is not totally a bad thing since I cover all the expenses for home    But she keeps having heart Attack like anxiety attacks and being upset all the time  At that time I saw a message in her phone from her best friend  nevermind in this way you two will miss each other more and this is good   a thinking got to me and I looked up her for tonight  She is planning to move in to dorm when her mother come and she is planning stay in dorm after that   I felt betrayed since she didnt share this with me and also I changed my home and rented this one  a year ago just for us because it is close to her university  My old house was    min away from my firm now this one  takes   hours to commute   I also cant understand the logic here  if she is hesitating to lie her family about living together why didnt mind untill now  Also why she is feeling so bad for her father because he pay for her dorm  in everyway he was supposed to do  I mean if she doesnt live with me  her father will pay her dorm or student home  he is already paying and she doesnt spend a dim for our home expenses from her father s money  I really dont understand   We had some bad arguments for the last   months  I think Maybe she doesnt want to live together anymore but I cant be sure  If that is the thing  I cant accept her moving out since this is not acceptable I mean changing the intensity of relationship is a red flag for me   I also how to handle this situation  I am planning to talk to her saturday and telling her I guess she wont be back at our home and will stay at dorm  I dont know if this is a right move   I also have insecurities since I gained some weight and lost my shape and my head started go bald  Thinking that she dont think I am handsome or charismatic enough    
704,0,Concerned my    f  long distance boyfriend    m  might have a problem with alcoholI have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for   years  The last   of those years have been long distance since I moved to a different country for grad school  When I lived in the same city as him  I personally felt like he drank maybe a little bit more than I was comfortable with but when I brought it up with him but said that it was really only social drinking  He did seem to take my concerns seriously as his own dad is an alcoholic and he never wanted to turn out to be like him but I feel the amount of drinking didn t really change  I come from a community where everyone knows everyone and given this  my mom also heard about his drinking and came to me with concerns  I dismissed this at the time because my mom has dealt with a lot of alcoholics in her lifetime and is overly sensitive about people drinking alcohol in general  even with me  I accepted my bfs answer about being a social drinker as my dad has also been an alcoholic his whole life and I thought I might be being overly sensitive as well     amp  x   B   A few months ago I told myself I would not drink alcohol or eat out for   months until after I was done writing my big board exam that I have to pass to be licensed in my field  I asked my bf if he wanted to do it with me and he agreed but wasn t that serious about it  He lasted   month before breaking it for an event and then didn t stop again  I brushed this off given it was my resolution and he wasn t that serious about it in the first place  He hangs out with his older cousins a lot who definitely drink a lot  like go on benders every weekend   He looks up to them so I don t know if hanging out with them is influencing his perception of what a normal amount of drinking is  If people are hanging out in a group he seems to think that you won t have as much fun unless you re drinking or doing weed  Even if he s said that he doesn t feel like drinking before hand or isn t going to drink at whatever event hangout  he never seems to be able to say no if someone offers him a drink or tries even the slightest to convince him to have one  He doesn t drink that often when he s alone as far as I know but does weed more often in these situations  If he feels like having a glass of wine at home by himself he ends up drinking the entire bottle because apparently you can t cork it and it goes bad  I don t think this happens that often though  He does have periods of time where he drinks less  but these times seem to correspond to an increase in weed use instead  We ve gone on a few all inclusive vacations in groups and he seems to think that the fact that the alcohol is unlimited means you should be drunk all the time  As in wake up and get a drink first thing in the morning    amp  x   B   Recently i ve become concerned because my sister hangs out with my boyfriend s best friend and my boyfriend a lot even when I am not in the city and when they were out one day  my boyfriend s best friend brought up the drinking saying hey I seriously think you have a problem with drinking and weed  He used examples such as you said you would only have one beer today and look how many you ve ended up having  enough to get drunk and he has a high tolerance  and you never say no if someone offers you alcohol  He didn t seem to really want to engage in that discussion and I don t think it went anywhere  I don t think this is a full blown addiction yet but I feel like i m seeing patterns that make me uncomfortable  Perhaps this an issue with binge drinking in social situations more than the constant drinking I associate with alcoholics  I do talk to him daily and he s never really been drunk when I talk to him  He has a job  as well as   different side businesses so he s always busy and hasn t let any of that falter at all  I don t know if I m over reacting right now or how I should bring this up with him considering we re long distance  The next time I will see him is in   weeks at an all inclusive vacation we have planned  the first with just us two alone   Sorry if this post is long and all over the place 
705,0,I just found messages on my      bf s      phone  pm and it s to his ex saying she is the love of his life    she says she s making dinner  He gets all sad and is like  why don t you have dinner with your fianc   and she says he s having dinner with his parents and be there in   minutes    and then it goes silent   but there s phone calls at the same time  Then the next morning he s saying thank you and asks if he left his keys in her car  This was a week ago  He s done this so many times now it s lost all shock factor and I m just feeling sick laughing at how stupid I am and how much of a cheating asshole this guy is  Tonight she called him and he ignored it    I get mad and he tells me how he feels about me  How he would go crazy if I left him  how he loves me and  chose  me  He said  about his ex  fuck her and she isn t around anymore and she just randomly called him    i said how he has cheated on me in the past with her and it just hurts whenever I see her name or think about it    and he said I just have to move on and focus on right now    I don t know how to break up with him because he always twists things and somehow gets his way    eventually I just relent and let him see me     it just seems so unreal like it s not even happening and I forget about it and hug him or whatever  He doesn t know I know about the messages yet  I still love him and I can t believe he doesn t love me   what do I do 
706,0,Should I tell my boyfriend how I feel     I m aware that this is a dumb question but hear me out  I ve been dating my boyfriend for   months or so and I have crazy intense feelings for him  I ve almost dropped the L word a few times but I ve been pretty stubborn about him saying it first very high school  I know  but      I ve been the one taking initiative throughout most of our relationship  I asked him out  I made the first move  I asked if he wanted to officially be monogamous  In a way  it makes me feel like he s just along for the ride  and going with what I say because that s what s easiest for him  If he were to express that he loves me without me initiating it would mean a lot to me      I don t want to pressure him into saying anything he doesn t mean  or make him uncomfortable  It can take him a long time to process emotions and I don t want to back him into a corner by telling him I love him before he s ready    So how petty am I being  Is it stupid for me to want him to take the lead on this  Should I wait it out  I really want to tell him how I feel  but I don t want to get an insincere response or feel like he s with me because I m making it easy for him  If I m being ridiculous please let me know

710,0,Waiting until marriageMy Girlfriend and I have been together for about a year now  and everything has been good  Minding the bumps and hurdles of a long distance relationship has been difficult  but we have made it work  Now I will get to the gravy  we have had sex plenty of times  our affection and intimacy is something that is a big part of our relationship as it is with most  but she brought something up to me today  She said she wants to stop having sex and spend more time being us  we waited   months to start have any kind of sexual activity and I figured that would be enough to prove that we both respect and love each other without sex  She s only recently started getting back in touch with her faith which doesn t bother me but I m not to big of a religious guy  It s not that I don t believe I was just never brought up that way  Im not to sure what to do and if I should say that I don t like that idea because I know it would make her upset  Any advice would be appreciated  thanks 
711,0,Boyfriend with a drinking problem  out of work and living with me  Is this relationship worth pursuing or am I just deluding myself  Advice please Me     F  and my boyfriend     M  met online last year and have been together for just over   months   There have been a series of possible red flags which I ve ignored tried to look beyond or probably just deluded myself into thinking they are not important but I m now at a point where I can t figure out whether I should just let this relationship go or whether I just need to work at it be less critical   As a bit of background  when I first met my boyfriend he was working in what I thought at the time was a great job  he has his own place and I had mine  Within   weeks of us knowing each other he started having trouble with his landlord who wanted to sell his apartment and for my boyfriend to move out  At the time I didn t want him to be left in the lurch looking for a new place so I said he could stay with me for a short period of time while he looked for a new apartment thinking that it would at most be a month   I made it clear that I didn t want to move in with him  especially after only knowing each other for   weeks and that the arrangement was temporary  I even went to apartment viewings  which I had to nag him to make  to try and jump start him into finding a new place  Fast forward to today    months later    and he s still living in my apartment   He talks of getting his own place from time to time but never actually follows through with any intent     To make matters worse he lost his job at Christmas due to him turning up drunk to work   I suspect there is more to the story but he won t tell me  he didn t tell me he lost his job because he was drunk he made up some other excuse  I had to find out about that from a mutual friend    Because of that he hasn t had an income which has meant even less chance of him moving out   Since he moved in  supposedly on a temporary basis  I have paid all the rent on my apartment and all the bills  power  gas  internet   Since he lost his job at Christmas I have paid for all food  plus his additional costs like train tickets and money to take his daughter out  he has a   year old daughter from a previous relationship    While I have a great job and a good income and can technically afford to pay for the two of us I can t help but feeling like he s taking advantage of me the situation and that I m just being used and abused as he has never offered to contribute to the rent or bills  even when he was working    He doesn t seem to have any real savings  despite him suggesting otherwise  and I can t help but wonder if this lax approach to money is something that will continue on in future which worries me if we were to get married have kids    When we first started dating he was very open about having had an issue with drugs and alcohol in the past of which he assured me he was clean and sober  and had been for some time and that he has been homeless for a period due to his substance abuse issues   I ll admit I didn t know how to deal with that initially as I ve never been around or been involved with anyone who had a past substance abuse issue but I wanted to give him the benefit of not judging him on his past   Over the past   months that hasn t turned out to be true  at least in relation to alcohol  In addition to finding out he had lost his job due to being drunk  which I was shocked about  who goes to work drunk    there have been multiple times I ve either come home from work and found him drinking or I ve found empty bottles hidden around the apartment  I ve confronted him multiple times about his drinking and he either gets really defensive and angry at me about bringing it up and in his view  rubbing it in his face  or he is contrite and assures me it will never happen again  only for a bit of time to pass and for it to happen again    And just if I didn t need any more red flags he has been stealing cash out of my purse when he thinks I don t notice  presumably to spend on alcohol    He has started a new job this week so whatever ends up happening with our relationship I am hoping that I can get him to move out sooner rather than later   I realise that I can just tell him to get out now but based on what I have seen about his lack of financial resources I think he would be homeless if I did so     We get on well and have a good time together but all of this stuff has put a strain on how I feel about him   I know he genuinely thinks I m great and he loves me and wants to have a life with me but I can t help but think that I ve just been so stupidly naive and that I ve been taken advantage of   I think he s great and from a connection point of view  just the kind of guy I would want to be with however all of the lies  the drinking  lack of resources  stealing and a suspicion that I m just being taken advantage of means I really don t trust him   I want a family some day  even if I can t have kids I want some fur babies  and I want an equal partnership  I realise that may mean one person earns more than the other  it s not all about money I just don t want to think that my partner is just using and abusing my good nature time money   I ve lost perspective on this relationship and that so much has happened in   months and I really would love some impartial views on whether to move past these initial issues or whether to call it quits    TL DR boyfriend of   months moved in after   weeks  doesn t contribute financially  lost his job  has a drinking problem and steals cash  We have a great connection but I m struggling to figure out whether to keep pursuing the relationship or let it go due to everything that has happened in the last   months 
712,0,More nervous about second first kiss than first ever kissSo this may or may not be a super odd question but I m gonna do my best to explain it   My    F  ex     M  was my first kiss  We were together for three years and he s the only person I ve ever kissed  Because we were each others first ever relationship and we were so young when we got together  it took us   months to hug and   whole months to kiss  Well we broke up a few months ago and I started dating a long time friend  Today he hugged me after hanging out and I realized that relationships typically move a lot faster than what I was used to  It s not that I m uncomfortable my the guy I m dating  I ve just found myself really nervous for our next date because he ll probably try and kiss me but I m super nervous  Any tips on a brand new relationship after a very long term first one 
713,0,I    F  think I might be monitoring myself too much to avoid my SO    M  getting in a bad mood  Need advise on how to talk about problems without causing bad mood Obligatory on mobile so sorry for the format  and English is not my native language     I ve been in a relationship with my SO for two years now  at first it was a LDR but we moved together a year ago  Everything has been fine and dandy  and we rarely fight   when we do it s only about petty things  However  lately I ve noticed myself avoiding talking about certain topics  and avoiding commenting on things that make me uncomfortable to avoid my SO s bad mood  He is usually in a good mood  and he doesn t act out or anything when his mood is bad  he is just cold and goes to another room     Examples of issues I avoid talking about is sex  We used to have a lot of sex  but for the last two months we ve had relatively little sex  This is because I ve had some issues with bad odour from my vagina  which I m trying to cure  I ve been to the doctor but the last treatment didn t work so I have to try something else   The smell isn t always there  but when I  smellcheck  I may think it smells bad that day  but my bf doesnt  so I feel like I never really know when I will smell bad  This has lead to me not initiating  because I am afraid I will smell     My bf has not been seriously initiating either  he only does it  jokingly  where he will honk my breasts or grab my pussy without forewarning or any kind of warmup  which is really uncomfortable  He also complains that we never have sex  but not in a serious manner so if I try to say something serious about it he makes fun of me for not understanding sarcasm  After yet another comment about us never having sex today I told him it s because I might smell bad  but he didn t take me seriously and joked it s because I don t love him  I want to talk to him about his joking about our sex life and his  joke attempts  at initiating are making me uncomfortable but I don t do it because I m afraid he will only be offended but not change anything     Another topic is his health and his school  He complains all the time that he needs to start working out  and asks me to help him and force him to go  But when I try  he will not come  We went to the gym a week ago  but on the day I got very annoyed because we had an agreement to go straight after lunch  but after lunch when I was ready he  just had to take a protein shake  but sat on his computer and then took forever to change while I waited for him  We left for the gym   hours later     He is also a bad student and never studies except for doing mandatory assignments  but then complains alot that school is hard and he never has time to study  even though he spends many hours every day watching videos and gaming  If I make any comments about this he will get moody and seem to resent me for at least a few hours     To top it all of  he often tickles me and pokes me  and does small physical things that don t hurt  but is uncomfortable  As a result I often flinch when he comes to touch me because I expect it to be uncomfortable  This makes him sad because my flinching makes him feel like an abuser  I have not told him it is because of all his tickles and occasional pokes     What I need advise about is how I can initiate a serious conversation about all of this without making him feel attacked  and without overwhelming him with all of these issues that have piled up over the last months      Edit  put in some more space in the post so it wouldn t be so compact  
714,0,I    M  don t know what to make of this situation with this girl    F  I hung out withI texted a girl I haven t seen for a while to catch up over lunch  We talked for     hours  She asked me what I m doing for spring break  I said I was thinking about going to the zoo  She said that we should go together  We ended up going to the aquarium instead because zoo tickets were      Tbh  I m not sure what to make of what happened  I said that it was a nice day today  and I asked her if she wanted to do anything like go to the beach afterwards  She said no and that she already had plans  I asked her if she wanted to see a movie later this week  She said she prefers to see movies by herself  It kinda seemed like she was turning down all my offers to hang out   She did seem to have a good time  like I was able to make her laugh many times  I bought her a plush octopus  and she looked a little uncomfortable  I m not sure if it s because she doesn t like gifts or because she doesn t like me   She did say that if she ever has something she doesn t want to do alone  she will ask me first  She also said she doesn t really hang out with other people   She didn t touch me at all like a friend told me how girls flirt  but then again  she is a very private person  She said she has had other relationships before  I don t know how she went about those though   I don t know if she sees anything with me at all  I don t even know if she enjoys my company or not  I m completely lost tbh 
715,0,What to do when my    f  long distance bf    M  of   months lacks problem solving skills My boyfriend and I met online but he has visited me in my country once and he will visit again in a few weeks   The Relationship is great so far and he is the best thing ever to happen to me  Great man   The problem is that he lacks problem solving skills and it is starting to bother me  Naturally  when I have an issue or something is bothering me  I choose to call him first or vent to him but he always gives me a blank look or goes quiet instead of offering advice  solutions or even words of encouragement   Am I right to worry about this and to expect that my man at least tries and offers me advice or helps me solve the problem   together     Tl Dr Long distance bf lacks problem solving skills  How can I deal with this  
716,0,What are the chances of me getting him back I was dating a great guy for about a month  we made things official  and then his ex girlfriend came back into his life and he broke up with me  He had been pretty vocal about this ex girlfriend being abusive  unappreciative  and making him very unhappy so it seems as if he is caught up in the nostalgia and ease of just continuing the relationship with her  I ve never had more in common with a man as I have with him  we both agreed that it seemed as if we had found the opposite gender versions of ourselves  Of course I don t know him       but on top of us having tons in common and me being attracted to him  he is kind  successful  intelligent  patient  honest    honestly everything you want a dream partner to be  He admitted that he did care for me   as we had been friends for months before dating  and that he thinks I m a good woman and he likes me a lot  but he still loves his ex and they had planned a future together so he was confused and didn t want to waste my time or hurt me any further by staying with me   At the end of the day I know I should let this go with my dignity  after all he chose someone else and that speaks volumes  It s been just over three weeks since he broke up with me and a little over a week that they ve been back together  But I can t help but wonder if there s anything I can do or say to help him get out of this abusive relationship and give us a chance  I know I probably sound pretty pathetic but I m feeling really low 
717,0,My Girlfriend is extremely dumb and im not sure I can copeim gonna start this off by saying im not egotistical and i dont think im smart in any way  i am incredibly average   However  my s o s lack of logic and intelligence gets in the way of almost every conversation  almost every outing  and i get incredibly frustrated  it feels like im dating a child  she cant spell simple things like  corner  or use the correct you re  whenever i try to have a serious conversation with her  i have to explain nearly all of my points after ive said them because she doesnt understand  it took her nearly   months to figure out how to hang a canvas i got her for valentines day  even after literally showing her how   im struggling with this because my ex was an avid reader and an extremely high achiever  and was far  far smarter than me  im not adapting well to this change and arguments often occur ecause of how utterly infuriated i become from her lack of common sense  she often refuses to check her messages for grammatical errors and ends up sending me a block of text that i literally cannot read  its affecting my attraction to her and killing the spark because we often argue  she doesnt know who our own prime minister is  Australia  or anything thats going on in other countries or even our own  i know its extremely selfish of me  but i miss being able to just talk with my ex for long periods of time about all sorts of things  with no issues  and discussing interesting topics that i had fun with because she was smarter than me  and therefore would enlighten me on interesting things i never knew before  im not sure how to cope anymore and i feel its killing our relationship  she doesnt know i have any of these feelings and i try my best not to make her feel dumb but im not sure how much longer i can keep it up

719,0,I   m  don t know my next moveThis past September I started my freshman year in college  and met a girl    f   I really liked  We had class together but she had to transfer because of personal reasons but we had each others numbers from a class group chat  I know that s not too uncommon  but no one got to me like she did  This was one of those situations where I would look at her and tense up cause I was nervous about doing something to make myself look like an idiot and drive her away  Eventually i got the nerves up to text her and we started talking and I felt it was going well  she seemed fairly interested  we d talk and text  she d facetime me and we d talk for    hours  I thought she was into me   At the end of first term one of our classmates and mutual friends was having a small party at their house to celebrate the end of first term  and I ended up driving her from the campus  she didn t have a license or a car at the time and lived off campus  so we hung out for a while after class and then we went out to the friends house  There was about six of us there and we played games and w e  Me and her are sitting on the floor at a coffee table and for almost a half hour shes tapping on my leg but I thought nothing of it because I have ADHD and tap on stuff all the time  but one time I started tapping on her hand and she just grabbed my hand fingers interlocked out of seemingly nowhere so we re just holding hands now  My fucking heart is soaring over the moon at this point  and about an hour later we decide to head back to the dorms  where she would hang out until someone had came to pick her up  she lived off campus about    mins away   we re in my dorm chilling talking about classes and whatever not much else happens  someone gets there and I walk her downstairs and outside to the car she hugs me and leaves   We kept texting and stuff on and off until around mid November but I haven t heard much from her since then  except for when she texted me in December saying she could see me from the window in one of my classes  I missed it in class but texted her after  got no reply  and haven t heard from her since  All this to ask  Is there any way to recover the relationship  Or is this a closed chapter    amp  x   B   TL DR  Me and a girl I really like haven t talked in a few months and I really want to reconnect but I just don t know how

723,0,I    F  keep dreaming about my ex and I fear that it will afect my current relationshipHello everyone  So this is my first post  I just created my account  in fact  I m still trying to figure out how to like posts and comments  but I wanted to share this as soon as possible   I broke up with my ex nearly two years ago  after a few years dating  We were both pretty young and we had a really bad breakup  He cheated on me and then dumped me in a very rude way  so I kind of hate him   I got over him and eventually started my current boyfriend    M   He s great and we are in love  However  my ex is still haunting me because I keep dreaming about him every few weeks   I don t really believe dreams have a meaning or stuff like that  but they really affect my mood  I usually remember my dreams and I share them with my friends and boyfriend if they are funny or weird  When I dream about my ex  sometimes he begs for my forgiveness  sometimes I try to seduce him  etc  It changes every time  Last night I dreamed that we had sex and he wanted us to get back together even though he has a new girlfriend   The thing is  my boyfriend is not jealous  and I used to tell him about these dreams  but after a while I noticed that he felt bad and possibly insecure about me dreaming with my ex  since he hates him for hurting me  He already knows that dreams don t mean nothing  but I am worried that he might think that I m still in love with my ex  which I m not  or something similar   What should I do  just pretend that I don t have these dreams  not tell him  tell him but make sure he knows that I m only in love with him  What worries me the most is that he feels insecure  not jealous  because as I said earlier he s not jealous or toxic   That s all  I hope I get some advice and thank you for reading    amp  x   B   EDIT  I forgot this  My ex and I live in the same town  Luckily  I haven t runned across him since we broke up  but I do run across his friends or relatives from time to time  I sometimes dream about them too  
724,0,What can I  M    say to my terminal ill uncle  m    at what may be my last chance to see him So yeah  title  For the most part of my life until recently I ve been very introverted and didn t talk much  Despite this I care deeply for my family although I may not always have showed  My uncle lives in another part of the country and it s expected he may likely pass in april  This sunday I leave for a ten day trip to South Korea and I will visit him saturday    hour drive     My uncle is really already in the stage that he is slowly giving up and I am very well aware that he is not capable of lightheartedly reminiscing the past with me  I have not had many one on one moments with my uncle but I always held him in high regard because he really is a good man and a caring father for his wife and kids    What can I say to convey that I care deeply about him and will never forget him without coming off as that I only just say that now because he is in his deathbed  I m terrible at expressing emotion and always have been  But at this moment I really want to  I don t want to tire him with a long monologue  because he plainly doesn t have the energy for long interaction  I just want him to know I love him as my uncle  That I have always respected him greatly  and that I care for him very much despite seeing him only   x a year

732,0,My    F  boyfriend    M  of   months hasn t introduced me to anyone in his life  I m worried about his past relationship      Bit of a long one  there s a fair bit to unpack here   So  I    F  have been with my boyfriend    M  for   months now  I knew he was married from early on in the relationship  but he told me they were separated and not living together  As far as I am aware this is all true and over the last   months he hasn t given me much reason to doubt this  or so I thought until I had a little moment of clarity this morning and things aren t adding up    I have only met his sister briefly in passing once  and she seemed to be ok with my presence  I ve been to his house twice since we ve been together  both times was when no one else was there  Except when his sister came home early once  I wasn t given any kind of formal introduction and he hurried me out of the house fairly quickly  I confronted him on why he acted this way  he said it s because his family an ex were very close and he doesn t want to introduce them to someone new so soon  Fair enough right    However  it s been   months since we ve been together and now coming up to a year since him and his ex separated and I still haven t been introduced to ANYONE from his life  no colleagues  friends  family  He s met everyone on my side  stays at my flat several times a week  we ve been on weekend breaks together and have genuinely been conducting a normal relationship  except the fact that as far as I m aware  apart from that one meeting with his sister NO ONE EVEN KNOWS I EXIST  He hasn t even mentioned me to friends and doesn t really tell people where he is if he s with me    He doesn t have me on any social media  he says he doesn t use it and he has everything on super private settings so I can t see anything unless he adds me which he categorically won t do  He goes from being all over me and telling me he loves me to barely saying it from week to week  staying at mine nearly every night to barely seeing each other    There are lots of other little things that unsettle me as well  I know somethings going on but he s not very open with me  I want to approach him and explain that I m getting bored of feeling like a dirty secret and I want to be acknowledged as a part of his life  but I don t want him to get defensive and shut the situation down  I don t know how he could be getting away with seeing me if him and his wife are still together considering how much time we spend together but I still smell a fish  I need help with how to approach it 
733,0,Me M    and my GF F    broke up for   months and she slept with somebody from work Throwaway account because I m not sure if my GF knows my reddit account   I feel like I need to give a small bit of backstory so you can better understand my situation    amp  x   B   So basically me and my gf broke up for about   months  We had been together for almost    months at that stage and just hit a really rough patch in our relationship  I messed up and so did she  but nothing major  just constant fights  I started to feel that I didn t love her anymore because of the constant negativity in the relationship and missed what we had in the beginning  I told her that I wasn t sure if I loved her anymore but that I would like to work things out and fix it  She obviously didn t take that very well and broke up with me   days later because she felt it was unfair if I didn t know if I loved her or not    amp  x   B   We actually broke up on really good terms and we had a last date and laughed and cried together at different memories  I soon realized after a few weeks that it wasn t that I had fallen out of love with her it was just that I found everything very stressful and found that she brought forth a lot of negativity  Which wasn t always her fault since she was going through a lot in her own life  I knew I had messed up and tried to reach out to her to fix things and told her that I was sorry and that I would love to meet up for a chat  She pushed me away on multiple occasions  I soon found out that she had been hanging out with a guy she knew from her work a lot  I confronted her about it and she said they were just friends and that he was going through some stuff and wanted to help him  I took her word for it but felt really uneasy about the whole situation  She eventually told me she had feelings for somebody else about   months after our breakup and that she only saw me as a friend  Which hit me like a ton of bricks because of how much I wanted to fix things  She insisted that it wasn t the guy she had been hanging around with almost every day  She said she d try and figure her feelings out but came to me a day later saying she had made up her mind and that she no longer saw me in that way anymore     amp  x   B   I cut contact with her soon afterwards because of how much that hurt me  A few weeks later I m talking to a mutual friend and they tell me that she had slept with somebody and when I asked who they told me that it was the guy I was worrying about  I had never felt so numb  I confronted her and she didn t give me an answer at first and then broke down about how much she missed me and how much she loved me and that she just wants to fix things     amp  x   B   We ve been back together for   months now and things have been going greater than ever  But I can t get this guy out of my head  What shocked me more is that she had never been with anybody outside of a relationship before so it really hit me when I found out about it  Because it was very uncharacteristic of her  They slept together multiple times in the space of     weeks but it was after I cut contact with her  They also had unprotected sex which I feel is the most upsetting because it took me and her a few months to get to that level of comfort to try that but she did it within a week or two with this guy  They also work together almost every weekend so there s no putting him in the past because I still have to think about the both of them while shes in work    amp  x   B   She no longer hangs out with him outside of work  And we ve talked about it a good few times  but she feels as if I m somewhat guilt tripping her when I bring it up  I know at the end of the day she really didn t do anything wrong  we were broken up and she had no obligation to me  But I think it s just that fact that it was the person I worried about and that it was multiple times and it felt like she basically replaced me     amp  x   B   I really just want to put it all in the past  because I don t want to ruin how great everything has been  I just wondering if there is any sort of advice on how to deal with these situations  I do think I have a strange way of looking at it because a lot of people don t see anything wrong with it  I think it s mainly the fact that I was still deeply in love with her and was trying everything to fix our relationship and she pushed me away and did these things     amp  x   B   TLDR   GF slept with somebody from her work while we were broken up for   months  Was somebody she had told me was just a friend and not to worry about  We re back together now for   months and things around going great  Can t get the thought of the both of them together out of my head  Don t want to ruin how good things have been    amp  x   B    amp  x   B 
734,0,What does it mean when a girl     f  copies you     m  is she trying to get my attention We ve been friends for four years now  I m kinda into her  Lately  I ve noticed she seems to imitate me   like if I share something on social media she ll share a similar post  I ll change my profile pic she does   She has done similar with guys she s dated in the past     When we re together especially when I m with another girl  she ll order the same food as me  or she ll look at her phone when I do  It s similar things like this  maybe it s just coincidence  I m not sure    She ll seem to ignore me too   if I ignore her for the day because I m with a friend or I m genuinely busy  She ll do the same the next day  She is dating this other guy who just happens to be my age   has been for   months    A friend thought she might be waiting for me to do something  
735,0,I  F     keep convincing myself that my boyfriend  M     is dead I started dating my boyfriend back in October  in November I was involved in a car crash where I was sent to the hospital where I found out I was pregnant  The whole situation ended up a lot better than expected  we moved into together in December and everything has been really good since then  The first week of February we decided to move to Colorado  from Virginia  to be closer to his family since it was our first baby and I don t have any close relationships with mine   The second week of Feb I went to my first OBGYN appointment here in CO and we found out our baby had passed away  so I gave induced birth two days later    Ever since then we have been inseparable  After leaving the hospital I couldn t even go to the bathroom by myself  take a shower or do literally anything without having a panic attack  If I take a nap and I wake up and I can t see him I think I m all alone    My boyfriend is totally okay with this  He s really over protective and he really likes being next to me at all times anyways  He always asks me if he s smothering me  and at first after I started dealing with it I did feel overwhelmed as I m not that way in a relationship usually and he seemed to be that way naturally  But now  it s fine  He s my best friend and I like spending all my time with him  And doing things that are very intimate like showering and such with him makes me gain confidence in a way    He went for an interview Monday to which I went with and stayed in the car  I didn t have anything else to do and didn t want to stay at home alone anyways  Plus this was normal  His second interview with them was this morning  He asked if I wanted to go and I woke up late so I said no  besides we are both starting jobs again since our baby passed so we would not be spending all day together like we have been  Figured it was a good opportunity to get the feel on missing each other and being a part    He was supposed to text me when he got there to let me know he was okay  He didn t    Now  this a running theme every time he leaves  I have convinced myself he is dead and I m counting down the minutes until it s an appropriate time to call his mom and tell her I don t know what to do because he hasn t called me and I don t know if he got there safe    I m not an overbearing person usually and it s not that I don t trust him but I am freaking out and wondering if this is the last time I would have saw him    How will I even handle the anxiety of him driving places and knowing he s alive at all seconds of the day  What if it starts to take a toll on him and I lose him  What if the anxiety of convincing myself he s dead all the time hinders me from doing anything in life   tldr  Every time I m not around my boyfriend I think he has died  
736,0,Rejection adviceI m feeling a little frustrated with myself    I    F  started seeing a guy    M  back in July  but for personal reasons  depressed and just not ready  didn t get serious with him  We hung out and kept talking here and there    About a month and a half ago  I knew I was ready to actually date and commit to him  He completely shut me down and is seeing another girl  his ex     I m just having trouble getting over it  because it s totally my fault  He really liked me  and I just couldn t commit at the time  He s a really good guy too  Rejection is hard and I m having trouble coming to terms that he doesn t want to be with me and is completely fine while I m not    I guess I don t know what I m looking for  I m just frustrated with myself  feeling like it s my fault  and it s been a month and a half and I m still thinking about this guy I ruined my chances with  
737,0,  years friends    years dating  moving  now what Hey sorry for the long  sappy post  Looking for a non biased view    My bf and I have known each other since  th grade  were both    now   He s been through a lot during that time   from dealing drugs on the streets to now working in youth ministry  He s a super great guy with a big heart for kids who went through what he did growing up  We ve only been romantic towards each other for three years now  officially dating for         We dated one other time in high school and he cheated  but I forgave him because he was cracked out then and is a completely different person now  or so I thought      We did long distance while I was in college for two years and have been living in the same state for one  I would fly to him and buy him tickets to come see me because he was broke doing nonprofit work and I had a steady job  He said he wanted to marry me a little after a year into the relationship and that s been a conversation ever since  During those two years  we had issues with sex  porn  and him talking to his ex  This past year  we ve been on and off frequently    The sex because we re both Christian and wanted to save it for marriage  but we ve still been having it  No hate to people who act differently in their relationships  We all have our own beliefs     It s hard to stop  Turns out sex is an awesome void filler for both of us    The porn because we both have beliefs against it  He worked with children who had been trafficked and I work in the field of psychology  and we agree that the industry contributes to trafficking abuse and can cause psychological damage to the people watching it  We also agreed that watching porn means stepping outside a relationship for personal gratification and is a no  All this being said  he s been addicted since high school  He says he s getting help for it and rejected the idea of going to counseling  even after promising to go if the sex and the porn continued   Honestly  the porn wouldn t hurt me as much if he didn t lie about it  and I ve caught him lying multiple times  I should admit that at one point when he tried to show me his computer history and open up about it  I shut him down saying that he could just have more on incognito  I shouldn t have been gentler and grateful that he was opening up and have since apologized    Finally  talking to his ex  He had all of his exes on social media until recently  When we first started dating he would talk about his most recent ex all the time in ways that we not necessarily appropriate  comments like  she just looks so much like a model  and  you just don t understand what it s like to have a relationship like that    He would also talk about how I m not his type but she was  and it hurt  Finally  I drew the line when she started calling him  baby  and told him he had to stop talking to her if he wanted this relationship to work  that was two years ago   Over and over I would catch him talking to her after he promised not to  It wasn t a big deal to me because they were just catching up  but I was still upset that he broke his promise  We had a similar problem when a girl he used to have a thing with contacted him  for a good reason  and then sent him porn and a few days later asked him to FaceTime her from bed  He said she just needed comfort and that I was being unreasonable  Eventually he stopped talking to her because apparently her boyfriend made her stop talking to him  my boyfriend   Other smaller instances came up  like talking to girls going on friend dates with them without letting them know that he was in a relationship kind of became an issue too  At this point I started to feel unheard and questioned a lot about his intentions  even towards his female housemates  Although my suspicions towards them were less reasonable  They are really nice girls   And he was getting frustrated with my lack of trust    Fast forward a couple months  After all this over the past three years  I found out that I was accepted to my dream job  something he encouraged me to pursue  which will send me overseas for two years  I was happy about it but worried about where I was leaving our relationship  I asked him if he promised he could be faithful and he said no  He explained that he couldn t know      if he would be the same person a year from now and didn t want to promise anything since he s broken so many promises to me before    I thought about this for a while and tried to bring it up a little while after Valentine s Day  Before letting me explain why I was confronting him  he broke up with me and kicked me out of the house because he said that I was uncommitted and unwilling to trust him  which the lacking trust part is at least partly true   Two nights later I get a drunk text from him that he still wants to marry me  The next day he wanted to meet up for lunch and talk about things and I agreed  We talk about how  yes  I was wrong to shut him down for opening up about the porn that one time and how he s upset that I feel weird about him hanging out with his female housemates alone  I heard him out  We decided to get back together and he told me that he would take down the dating profile he made while he was drunk  Later that night we talk more about him not promising to be faithful and how I feel weird about it  He got upset that I  communicated poorly  about the issue and hung up the phone    This is where I did a thing that I don t think was necessarily right  but hey    I had a feeling that he wouldn t delete his dating profile because of his lack of follow through in previous commitments  so I made a fake one and found his  I messaged him using the fake profile and before long he set up a date with the fake person  I called him right after to give him a chance to come clean and then called him out saying that he straight up wasn t a faithful person    He biked to my house in the rain to apologize and try winning me back  I told him that I love him but he has serious issues  After all the lying and broken promises he has to work out why he s been acting this way  Again  he has some amazing qualities  Maybe just some heavy baggage to work through  He gave me access to all of his social media accounts and said that he wanted to earn my trust back and that he still wants to get married  I don t feel right about having them because I want us both to have a healthy amount of privacy  granted he s had access to all of mine and I really don t care   but my insecurities got the best of me and I looked through his Instagram dms  I found out that while we were very much together he was dming the ex that he promised me he would stop talking to  Light flirting stuff like  yeah babe we ll you re a        and  how can I break my own heart if my only relationship is with Jesus   Like really  What tf  At this point I called him to break it off again and he promised it would stop  He deleted her from all social media  And I agreed to try again    So yeah  that s where we re at  My best friend things I m making myself miserable by being with him after all of this  She s the only one who know everything that s happened  In fact  most of our friends said we should end it  That being said  it s not easy to let go of someone you love knowing you can t be a part of their life  their family  and the future you planned together  I don t know what to think right now  It seems like things that weren t as big of issues before are becoming annoying as hell now  like his video game habits  ill times humor  and unhealthy lifestyle   but I honestly think that s just me projecting hurt and dissatisfaction onto more minuscule and concrete issues  Especially with my departure date being in   months  and the length of service being   years  I feel like we re in a rush to repair something and I m wondering if it s really repairable within that time  I still have hope though  Anyone been in a similar position  and does anyone have advice or constructive criticism  Thanks   
738,0,   sM  with    sF   interaction with male friend last night was weirdDidn t plan to meet up with my SO last night  but I was meeting one of my buddies for a drink later in the evening in the general area so she suggested we combine locations and for me to head out earlier    I had a rather underwhelming counseling session earlier in the day  so I wasn t in the mood to be overtly sociable  Still  I wanted to accommodate my SO s request  Little background on her friend  they went to HS together  and had a brief fling in college  They were meeting a mutual female friend    I arrived about mid way through their outing  and things were going okay  Had to force my way into topics since they weren t very accommodating  but I m okay with that and it s high school shit which is the last thing I want to wax nostalgic on    The other girl left  and so it was my SO  me  and her guy friend  I figured things would be a little more equitable in the conversation at that point  but it ended up being just weird  The guy barely made eye contact with me  didn t ask me any questions  and was generally just glossing over any contribution I made to the conversation  He had his eyes locked on my SO the entire time    This started to frustrate me  but it was cool because my buddy arrived and we left the table for a minute to get some fresh air  When we got back  it was more of the same  My SO left to the use the restroom  and he started probing on our relationship   asking questions about how we met  how serious we were  When I said something along the lines of  She s great and my favorite   I think he tried setting me up to confess by asking  Oh  she s the only one  No side girls    This was compounded by the fact that my SO is not the most consistent at introducing me or including me in conversation  so I didn t feel very acknowledged during the night for other reasons    I slept over and when we got back to her apartment  I shared my observations and told her it was weird that she focused practically all of her attention on him when it was  v v   She agreed and said she should have done more  and that she didn t want to see him alone which is why she suggested I come    She doesn t have many male friends  and I am cautious about expressing observations like those because I don t want to come across as jealous and constrain the already minimal platonic opposite sex relationships she has  She s an adult and is free to do anything or see whoever she wants    I sometimes get intuitive reads on people and he rubbed me the wrong way  His disregard and lack of inclusion told me he has ulterior motives with my SO  She has been really receptive to my feedback  but I don t know how to approach this moving forward  
739,0,I    F  just found out my fianc    m  cheated on me   times with happy ending massagesI m heart broken  He just packed his bags and went to his mom s  We ve been dating since end of      and just got engaged end of November       I had a dream last night he cheated on me with a few girls  Today  I snooped through his phone and went through his Google history  I found several days where he looked at different massage parlours on RubMaps  I confronted him about it and after much denial he finally confessed  He said he has received   hand jobs from   different parlours and   different women since December  Needless to say  the engagement is over  I m feeling kind of numb  and I m not sure where to go from here 
740,0,What do I do about it Okay so this is one of my first posts on Reddit I m still getting used to everything here so sorry    So I    F  and my boyfriend    M  have been together for a year today  When it s just us he s sweet and lovey but when we re at school he treats me like my whole existence is inconvenient  I m actually sick today so we can t go out for our anniversary and he had this whole big surprise planned and instead of postponing the date he literally replaced me with his best friend  I m really hurt about it and he s done this before  When I tell him I m hurt he doesn t seem to care  He seems to always find a reason to make me feel guilty about something  Like making me feel guilty about being sick  my friend told me he s toxic and we should just break up but I don t know  I just love him so much and I feel like I can t live without him  I texted him  I miss you  earlier and he said  good for you  he wasn t like this in the beginning but it seems like after   or   months he changed  Any advice will help me at this point    Edit  I should probably add that he has zero respect for anyone  He doesn t even respect his mother and they argue right in front of me when I drive all the way over there to visit  I love his mom to death and she s so so sweet  Should I just break up with him 
741,0,Me    M  and my crush    F   how can I make up We met in November and hit it off  and from there we had a connection and it was fun being with her   We texted and responded within minutes and even seconds  all times of day   However  she began being more distant recently  leading to me fucking up and sending a long text   After that  we haven t really talked  and removed each other from social media  and that was about a week ago   Apparently she thinks I m overthinking too much  which I know is absolutely true  I see her in school and we say hi  but she looks like she wants to say something to me  but I ignore her to save face  making every encounter very awkward   I really want to make things up with her  but we only pass by each other and don t really stay and talk   Should I add her back on social media and offer to talk about what happened  or should I just not contact her anymore   Also  if I do  when should I add her back 
742,0,I am too nervousSo I ve been on   dates with a girl  and things are going well  However  the last two dates she asked me if  I wanted to do it  my penis lost the erection after applying the condom  Both me and the girl are virgins and I am fairly certain it s because I m too nervous  Either way  it s getting really frustrating    any advice 
743,0,I broke my friends trust and I think I m going to lose herMy friend and I had a sort of a romantic relationship for a small period of time and we were intimate  I was confused at the time and was talking to another friend about her and I told her we were intimate  She found out about it and she s furious and won t talk to me  she s shutting me out and I m scared of losing her   I don t know what to do or say or not say to make it better and waiting around is really working up my anxiety and abandonment issues  And I m trying to tell myself it s okay and that she s mad but she cares about me and won t leave me but I m slipping away and I feel she hates me and she s going to throw me out of her life and I just can t lose her and everything we had together and I m just paralyzed by fear  I been sitting in my desk all morning just staring at the screen numb and I can t talk to anyone because it ll make things worse and just I don t know    TL DR shared information I shouldn t have with a common friend  she s upset and I m having a mental breakdown and I don t know what to do 
744,0,She      put soy sauce on her serving Mexican rice that I    M  made  Time to end it She justified it by saying   All rice gets soy sauce     Is this a deal breaker   EDIT  Yikes  Some of you guys need to calm down  I posted this in jest  She knows I posted this and finds it hilarious 
745,0,Is it normal for my    F  boyfriend    M  to  like  a picture of his ex or is this inappropriate My relationship with him has been great for the past     years  He recently asked about marriage and I told him I wasn t ready  so there s still a lot to discuss with him moving forward   This post is mainly about whether it s appropriate to  like  an ex s photo  He is no longer seeing the ex  but a few months ago  I found out he liked a picture of his ex on Instagram  based on the post date   Should I bring this up  
746,0,Broke up with me but still watches my Instagram Story I feel stupid for asking this but I just need some random opinions  here s the long short version   After about a month of dating hooking up my    M  girlfriend    F  said she didn t want to be together anymore  she doesn t think I m right for her    I didn t communicate with her for a week and gave her space  but no matter what I did to distract myself I could not stop thinking about her  so a week later I asked if we could get back together basically telling her what I wrote above  I can t stop thinking about you   She was even more adamant and harsh than before that she didn t want to get back together  and honestly her being kinda harsh kind of gave me the push I needed to start moving on   Here s where it s weird to me  or maybe I m just being childish   she still watches all of my Instagram stories everyday   I never watch hers because I don t want to catch feelings again   But seeing her picture and name every time I look at my stories just doesn t make it easier to forget about her and move on    I feel like it d be extremely immature of me to block her and I know she isn t interested in me anymore so    what do I do    Is blocking her so I don t have to see her picture everyday an asshole move  Is this strange for someone to keep watching your social media pages after they very adamantly broke up with you  Sorry if this is millennial and dumb but I am just so confused here   
747,0,I    m  miss one of my  ex  friends    f So December of       I started talking to a girl I went to school with  we were mutual friends before hand  Over the weekend we texted a lot and then Monday we just hung out a lot more  I had never felt that close to someone  like she knew me and actually cared about what I was saying  Another week passes and things were going pretty good  I watched one of her favorite movies and teased her about it  And then in the middle of the week I went to the school concert that she was in  and when we were outside and she was walking with her mom  I walk up to say hi to her  and she said her hellos and left  Later that night I was in a restaurant with my friends and texted her about homework or something  Then the day after she didn t answer one of my texts  okay no big deal  and then the next one  Then she just kinda made it clear she doesn t want to talk to me  I tried talking to her to see what the hell happened  she was kinda flustered and ignored me  I let a month go by  radio silence from her  I let another month go by  she kinda recognizes my presence but doesn t engage in conversation unless we re in a group talking  Now flash forward to now  I have most of my classes with this girl and I wanna be able to talk to her again  but can t out of fear  She seems kinda friendly to me in our photography class but once again that s cause we re in a group  I m kinda lost and left missing her  Any ideas of how to deal with this situation 
748,0,why do people be friends for ages before starting their relationship i just talked with a friend and he said he met his gf a year ago and they were friends for over a year before they became a relationship   to me i think people know very soon after meeting  whether they are attracted to each other or not   why would you stay silent about your feelings for so long and keep it at a friendship level   wouldn t it be better to be open about how you feel earlier  then can either get rejected and stay as friends  or the feeling is mutual in which case you can either stay friends and slowly become closer  or the relationship just intensifies from that vulnerability   i like someone and it is eating me up inside slowly  and now i m unsure if the smart thing to do is to be content with the friendship and let it progress naturally over time  or i tell them how i feel and face the fear of rejection  but have the release of being honest   thoughts  considerations  experiences 
749,0,How do I     F  ask my friend     F  to tell me  no   She seems to be unable to flat out say  no  about cancelling plans in  particular  This happens over and over and truthfully I am never  bothered by plans not working out so I don t know how to help the  situation  It usually goes like this     Friend and I  just me ask if she wants to do something   She gives a vague response that hints that she doesn t want to cant   I assure her that anything is fine and just let me know her choice as soon as possible   Last minute  I don t think I can        I thank her for letting me know she can t  I choose to treat it like a  no      I am irritated that she didn t just say no at the end  or the beginning  And  it continues  I want to confront this to make our lives easier  I  acknowledge that it could be a personal problem for her to work  through   but is there any way I can make her more comfortable to say no  to me my friend 
750,0,Always last place  Please helpMy    F  boyfriend    M  will put everything before me  This is super fresh so I m try to be reasonable with this post  My boyfriend and I have been together for     years  we work shift work and live about    minutes away so we have limited time to spend together  He came over to stay the night after work on Tuesday  knowing I would have to be at work at      am on Wednesday   Unfortunately on Tuesday night I was up all night with the flu  barely slept in the same bed  taking up residence on the couch not wanting to wake him when I ran to the bathroom to vomit   Eventually he woke up and found me on the couch and sat with me for a bit  then went and got me some fluids  and went home  He had the next two days off and I know he needed to get some work done  he is doing an online course   I asked him at that time can he come over the next when I m feeling better  he said maybe if it will make you feel better   so he spends the day doing work then goes out for wings with some friends and they play board games  usually this comes with a couple of beers of course   He messages me at       when he is about to sleep and again I ask if he can come over the next day  Again he says maybe he can do it   Flash towards today  I m feeling a bit better but not      so I ask him if when he is done his school work if he will come over  He says he wants to watch baseball at  pm  I tell him he can watch that at my house with me  And he can bring his work over for after I have class work I need to do too  he says he won t get any work done  And his whole plan was to do school work and watch baseball  And I m like uhmmm  where was this plan when I was asking you yesterday  if you d come over  Now I m pretty upset  I feel like baseball  is taking priority over me  I rarely ask him to put other things before myself  and I know school work is important  But it feels like he is willing to sacrifice his schoolwork for things he wants  I am also frustrated because when I asked him why he didn t tell me this was his plan from the get go if it was  all along  and he said it s cause I would have been mad at him yesterday   He is known to be horrible at communicating about things and he have run into this problem numerous times  In the messages he tells me to leave him alone numerous times  and swears at me  I do not reciprocate swearing or telling him to leave me alone  Now he is trying to back track saying I don t want him to do his work  when I initially asked him to come over when he was done his work  and he was the one saying he was watching baseball  This isn t the first time something like this has happened  I m crying and heartbroken  Please help

759,0,Confronting my Girlfriend      to delete her Fendom Twitter PageLast year October  I started my first year at Uni and was incredibly lucky to meet the most beautiful and perfect girl for me  We started off as being really close friends and now about   months ago we have officially got together  I love this girl so much and I know that she feels the same about me   Before we started dating  she had this fendom twitter page where she would get money from men by talking to them  sending pictures of her feet etc  She was pretty open about it to me and always asked if it was alright cause she cared about my opinion cause we liked each other at that point  She said she was doing this because it is easy money that she needs to support her self  At that moment I didn t mind  I thought it was minor and that she was basically getting handed this money for free for just talking to them   As time went on we started to fall for each other more and more when eventually in January she said that she loved me and I loved her too  I had fallen really deep for her and loved her more than anything and I still do   Recently she stopped using her twitter page for the last   months or so cause she was living with me but now she has gone back home for Easter and she has started using it again as she was low in money  But now the twitter thing has really started to bug me  that s because I have too much respect for her and her body and I hate how these men objectify her and how she is fine with it  Her body is worth way more than what ever these dirty men are giving her  I trust her and I know for a fact she would never cheat on me  I am not not worried about that  I just don t like her talking to these men to get money  one of her excuses to do it is because she feels bad that she can never buy me things and she does this so she can get me something for my bday  But I keep telling her that I am really happy with her and she doesnt have to give me penny more   I just don t want to upset her when I tell her that I want her to shut her twitter page down cause she is not doing great financially rn  She has told many times to let her know if twitter is going too far but everytime I bring it up she makes excuses to keep it running  I am unsure on how I am gonna ask her to close it down without being controlling  
760,0,Am I being played and used for sex  There is a huge chance I m in denial  Or just a hopeless romantic loser or both  HelpI m not entirely sure if this is the right place but I will give it a try   My boyfriend  HL  broke up with me a few days ago  We have been together for   years and it hasn t been very easy dealing with the break up  We were going through a rough patch the past few months and I still love him and I know deep inside he still loves me too  I happily left my job last year to move and be with him  Despite of us splitting up  I still currently live in his apartment  I have no savings and still on the hunt for work  although we don t share the bed anymore  A few days after our break up  I discovered that for whatever reason he joined a dating app  I obviously have no right to be angry as were not together anymore but it was still hurtful that he seemed to be moving on so fast  I confronted him about it and he didn t deny  I was angry and asked him if he s already looking to jump to another relationship or just want to hook up with somebody  He said   Maybe I am  Or maybe I just want to talk to somebody and meet new people    I just left and didn t argue because I know it will only end in a huge fight  This happened   days ago   Last night  we were in the living room having a drink and was watching a movie  I asked him if he could give me a massage because my back was hurting  Honestly  I was not trying to seduce him or anything like that but I missed him and it was an opportunity for me to have an excuse to feel his touch  It was all friendly in the beginning  but fter a while he started touching my back in a sensual way  He then started grabbing my breasts and kissing me softly in the neck  I tried to resist and stop myself but after all I was only human I got turned on and eventually gave in  He performed oral sex  fingered me  and played with my lady part until I orgasm  After that  he went all silent and hugged me so tight and whispered asking me if we can sleep on the same room tonight  And we did  We shared the bed and he was very sweet and cuddly and I could tell that he missed me  He started talking and said in a serious tone and teary eyed   What happened to us  Why were we fighting a lot  We shouldn t be fighting anymore like that    I only answered  I don t know  and we both went quiet and he hugged me and then kissed me in the forehead and we went to sleep spooning  Earlier also that night when he got home from work  I was joking if he has already asked girls out for a date and he said he hasn t yet but if that happens I will be the first one to know  I ignored it even though it was painful  I told him that maybe we can go out on a date instead  He paused for a bit and answered   Hmm  Yeah  Maybe  We can try    And in that moment  I was hopeful  I was hopeful that even if technically we are over  his doors might be still open for  us   I was already planning of things that we might do this weekend  go to the beach  visit some museum  drink at a bar etc  I slept that night with a happy heart  Until this morning      This morning we were both in a good mood  We both woke up feeling horny and we gave each other handjobs  We were teasing each other that when he gets home from work  we were gonna have some wild sex  Sex has never been an issue for us and we enjoy having sex with each other  We also have been talking about spicing our sex life more and we want to buy some new sex toys and was even considering of having a threesome  When he is in the office  I caught him twice looking at sex toys and other sex paraphernalia online for couples  I was excited and happy thinking that he is thinking about us  I told him that my only condition is for him to come home early and no more dating apps  His iPad and Mac are synced and I was snooped  judge me all you want  because I want to know if he will go with it  I checked his profile on my phone and he was online    I was so angry and in pain I decided to make an account and catfished him  We are chatting in this dummy account and I stirred the conversation into asking him who does he live with and he answered    At the moment I live with my ex girlfriend  It  i s difficult but we try to be friends  She does not have a job so I do not want to quit on her  We were together for some years so out of respect for  us  I told her that she can stay for two more months    I was crushed  I am crying while writing this  I even wished that he could just have lied and said that he lives alone and maybe in that way I might think that he really is just doing this for fun and nothing serious  I tried to clarify to him last night what we are doing  like if we are trying one more time or what and he would just answer me to not think about it too much and just enjoy our moment  That s what I have been trying to do but when I learned about this just now I do not know what else to think  Or maybe I do but some part of me is still in denial and hopeful  At some point  I even thought that him joining a dating app was just his coping mechanism with our break up  I thought that maybe he just needed validation that he is still on the radar and can still has game  Flirting with ladies and how many girls he can take out on a date  I mean not that he would literally go out with them but just enough to make them say yes  I know how fucked up that sounds but that s how I see it  He just turned    and I know that he became a little conscious about it specially that I am way more younger than him  But at this point with what he told me on the dummy account  I am almost convinced that maybe   maybe he is really on the process of moving on and not just flirting online  But I m pathetic and still on defence  While he was chatting with the dummy account  I texted him and said that I cannot wait for him to get home and he replied   I can t wait  I m horny    I am so lost I do not know what to do  I am obviously not brave enough to let us go but at the same time I am hurting  I feel like I am being mislead to a false hope  I am at a very vulnerable stage that i know when he comes home  I would still be running in his arms  I feel so sorry for myself but I want him  And I want to make it one last try  He will come home later and will be expecting that we are gonna have sex  I want too but it is a bit hard when there are thoughts like this in my head  I am not sure if I should confront him about it  should I wait a little more and see what happens  should I ignore it  I currently don t have any friends so here I am venting out and hoping someone could shed me some light  The last thing I need right now is judgement  so please I would appreciate if you refrain from bashing  I would however accept harsh truths  I m all for that

767,0,I m starting to second guess my recent breakup  Looking for perspective and advice Last week I    F  ended a relationship with a SO    M   We had been dating for   months with no forward movement    When we first started dating he was freshly separated and said he wanted to take things slow  The connection I have with him was pretty immediate and intense  but because of his divorce I was wary  As things progressed I started having deeper feelings for him and I eventually stopped dating other guys just before the holidays    I m a very shy person and had difficulty initiating a DTR talk  I d tip toe around it  talking about seeing each other more  or wanting him in my life  but it never progressed to a real in depth conversation about what we were doing   Last week we finally sat down and had the conversation  I told him I can t continue to be super casual about our relationship that I m starting to feel hurt by it  Then I asked for him to DTR  I told him I didn t want to date anyone else  only him  Then came the crushing blow  that he doesn t want to be exclusive and isn t sure if he will want a serious relationship again  He asked if it was an all or nothing situation for me  I said yes  since I don t really see how to compromise when one person is all in and the other isn t  I referenced the dreaded  fuck yeah    mentality and how I feel that way about him and I want to be with someone who feels that way about me  he said he does sometimes        So here we are   days later    of which I spent crying my eyes out  and I m starting to second guess myself  Did I push the commitment idea to strong especially considering his recent divorce   Should I have tried to talk it out over smaller conversations instead of unloading my feelings all at once   Or did I do the right thing by breaking my own heart now instead of later   EDIT  Additional info  we both have complicated living situations  fam  right now that may have impeded the natural progression of our relationship

769,0,Am I    F  being friendzoned by my boyfriend    M    LDR He and I live   hr from each other and have been together for   months now  Everything was fine the first   months  Then he kinda started isolating himself   not only from me  but also from his friends  He is usually not the so social type of a person  doesn t like going out that much but at the beginning of our relationship there was no problem   We used to see each other every     weeks  And now  we last saw each other a month ago  I have the feeling that he doesn t care that much about not seeing me  The reason why we don t see each other that often now is that he is busy  I can t say I have much free time since I am kinda busy with school and st uff too but I will always find time for him and he just won t    Last week I told him that I realized that we hadn t seen each other since a month and he said that he didn t know when he would be able to see me because he has upcoming exams n stuff  He has a whole weekend in which he can study  why is it a problem to see me for     hours  for example   Another problem is that we stopped face timing and we communicate only via messages and voice clips now    I feel like im in the friendzone tbh  The last time we saw each other was really fun but there was a lack of physical contact  We are usually holding hands but he stopped kissing me first and I m kinda worried about that  I have to also mention that he is not the touchy type of a person  and he has told me that several times before  but in the beginning there was no problem with all the hugging and kissing    He has told me that he had been feeling really sad every damn day during the last year and that is the reason why he ignores me  and his friends as well  sometimes    The last time we saw each other we had a conversation about his behaviour  He told me that he has some kind of a problem   he wants more friends  yet he isolates himself from everyone  He feels bad about not caring at all  when ignoring other people  He knows that this is a problem of his and is sick of it but says he just can t change it     I might be overreacting  I might be not  I just don t know if his feelings are fading  is he going through a phase or is he just cold when comfortable in a relationship  
770,0,I got back with my ex now he is back with her ex I was in a relationship with a guy for two years  then he broke up with me because he had a mid life crisis but we ended things on a good note  After two years of no contact  he came back out of nowhere and told me that I was the one  that he couldn t forget me and that when he thought about getting married or being in a delivery room I was with him in the picture    I bought him the love story and got back with him while ignoring that two months before he was in an   month relationship with some girl   the only formal relationship he had after we broke up for the first time   But he told me that being with someone else helped him realized that I was the one       This second time he ended with me again    months later  for the same reason  he preferred to spend time with friends instead of with me and that he never felt the chemistry and I felt that he wasn t sentimentally available and also didn t put the effort that promised  Once I asked if he still had feelings for his ex  first his answer was he didn t know but then he fix things by telling me that he appreciate her but it was with me who he wanted to be with       It s been two months now and yesterday he unfollowed me on Instagram and is now back with her ex  Am I wrong to think that he does not know what he wants  I found this situation very cynical    also I can not stop thinking that our relationship was just a rebound and that she has always been the one for him   Thanks for your advices

772,0,My bf says I love you  but it sounds insincereAfter seeing each other for some time  almost a year exclusively   I admitted I loved him  Initially  he said he didn t reciprocate the same feelings which totally crushed me  Then a day or two later he said he did love me but was afraid of commitment blah blah  Since spilling my feelings I ve said it once or twice  He has said it frequently since  but it sounds insincere and somewhat forced  I m confused why he would continue to say it if he were uncomfortable  Not sure what to do  Also  I m pretty sure he is hiding other things from me  Could he think I m that dumb to be persuaded to look past his sneaky behavior because he claims to love me  What am I missing

774,0,I    F  hooked up with a    M  man and I don t know what to doMy name is Jenny  or let s say it is   I am    years old and have a great job  great friends and a great apartment  Why am I telling you this  So that you ll know there s no underlying conditions to why I m acting irrationally   So a couple of months back I was out for a night on the town with some friends and ended up going home with this somewhat older man  He was really cute and we met when someone bumped into me at the counter and he caught me from falling  From the first moment we had this great conversation and he was just the right mix of strong and masculine and really friendly    As we were having breakfast the morning after I caught sight of his ID  His wallet was on the table and he was in the bathroom  I saw it right there and decided to check out how old he was as it was clear he was older than me  Turns out this guy is    years old   I had a major freak out and left stuttering something about having to leave  I was pretty embarrassed and didn t tell any of my friends  I mean  I had sex with someone who would be older than my parents  both passed away a couple of years back    Anyway a week later I m out with the girls again and at midnight I find myself drunkenly calling my Mr Silver and once again spending the night    After that night I decided to ignore how stupid this was  and just enjoy life  I m young  carefree and should be doing whatever I want to do right    Well  Sex has turned into something more  something I can t explain  This man       he just makes me feel so good  He can care for me and make sure I m alright  but also push me in just the right moment to do things I m afraid of doing  He is just the most solid part of my life and I have no idea what to do  I actually think I love him   Is there any way of keeping a relationship with a    year age gap alive  Should I cut my losses now and deal with a massive heartbreak or should I just for once in my life do what my heart tells me to 
775,0,Would you call and talk to your bf to somewhat confirm it s over  or just let the relationship die In the past month  my bf has canceled   dates  left for a weekend during our standing date  hasn t been verbally affectionate  basically has been talking and texting like I m just a friend  although when we are together he s very affectionate    I ve seen him probably   times the past month  He has apologized for being distant a few weeks back saying he has been stressed out  Yesterday  when he canceled our date last night  he said he hardly has time anymore  After the cancellation  he didn t even bother suggesting another day to see each other  and in the past  he has  So I m taking this as he has checked out and the relationship is over  or has been for a while   If I don t hear from him for a few days  should I call him to just see where we stand  or does   months not warrant that type of conversation given it s been a relatively short amount of time  And perhaps just let his silence speak to me and just let him pull the disappearing act without asking for an explanation  I ve just never disappeared on anyone before  I have always had the respect to tell them if I believe the relationship isn t working and or sustainable   Edit to add  Does it actually sounds like he is ghosting

778,0,I think I screwed up my internship So I am a criminal justice major with a minor in IT    I am currently interning at my local police station  Here I have been quiet at first as to avoid saying or doing anything to avoid getting into people s business  The most I ve talked about with then is asking questions about what they are doing and answering any questions they have about me  Mostly as to why I want to be a police officer with a minor in IT  to which i say how it is good to have a backup plan as the difficulty of getting into policing is     Now  I ve received some compliment from some  of the officers  n regards to how I am observant and that I use my head  Unfourtinatky as I get comfortable i feel liel I get a little over familiar with people  Thus  the problems begin with the last two days    Recently  they put me into a new spot where  rather then observing officers doing their job  ibmve been going through records and sorting them out  There  I ve encountered a new recruit and he and I have been talking  The topics range drastically  He talks about the force and who is in it and whatnot  Basic gossip on his end  I however  have responded  I said something about a police officer I do not know  I said she seems like the type of person who would enjoy fishing   Unfourtinatly  as I type this  I recall other things I have said a bit the people I ve encountered too     At this point I feel like I ve set myself up for failure by being involved int he gossip and putting my opinion out there  What would you folks recommend that I do   
779,0,   M  Been dating her    F  for   months  no longer feeling it I know what this might sound like from the title  typical leaving  honeymoon phase  and into something more steady  consistent and comfortable  It s not that  Once you take the passion away  IMO what should remain is trust  comfort  stability and I don t really feel those things anymore   For context  prior to dating  we were best friends for years     and went through a lot together  Since dating  we ve gone through a LOT of fights  break ups in the double digits           a pregnancy  amp  ensuing abortion  We also have ridiculously good times together and I ve legitimately never had so much fun with someone before and she s been the easiest person to talk to for the longest time  Hobbies line up  music tastes  show preferences  food preferences  date activity preferences   I ve been feeling worn down though  The prospect of introducing her to my parents  having her stay over at my place  I live with my parents   eventual engagement  marriage  kids  I just don t feel comfortable with the idea anymore nor do I see her in all of that    I think mentally  I m not treating our history  as a couple and as friends  as a sunk cost and I keep dwelling on it  like we ve already been through so much  the only way we can go from here is up  But our foundation has been so rocky  so full of fights I m not even sure we have a proper foundation  We both walk on eggshells with each other as we both still don t know what we re both comfortable with  conversationally  jokes  plans without each other  etc  Our sexual chemistry was extremely high in the beginning but it burnt down into essentially a dead bedroom at the age of     brought on by misunderstandings  anxiety  and a mental breakdown from her part that basically makes me scared to have sex with her in case all of that arises again    Ultimately  we both have a lot going on  We re both young professionals with struggling parents  our own student debt  and each with our own future to save towards  and I feel like we re on different wavelengths there  I save more than she does because I don t have car payments to make and I work a lot of overtime  also cuts into our time together   she wants to talk after I m done work and I want to too  but I need to catch up on sleep to do overtime again the next day   I save more than she does  but she has a problem with me wanting to go out more than she does  with or without her  Saying I m not at the same stage of life as her because I still prioritize friends so much but honestly  even when we re    and married  friends will still be a priority  Not over her  family  kids  job  but friends are an existence that will never be in my rear view  She s comfortable making her life all about me and family whereas I am not   Basically  is this worth it  Not just for me but for her  I love her a lot and I care about her a lot as both my girlfriend and my best friend  and I think she deserves to find someone that is all about her  which is what she wants

781,0,Does this make me    f  and my husband    m  strange Every time we go somewhere without one another we let each other know when we arrive and when we leave  For example  he texts me when he gets to work in the morning and I do the same when I get to work  If I m going to dinner or out with friends  i let him know when we get wherever we re going  If he s going fishing  he ll send me a text that he made it to the lake river  whichever he goes to that time   For is  it s not a control thing  its mostly to let the other know we made it to our destination safely  Some of our friends say this is weird

784,0,I    F  feel like I can t trust my girlfriend    F  anymore and it s ruined our relationship I ve browsed Reddit before but never this subreddit in particular so please let me know if this is the wrong place to post this   So context   Tessa   not real name  and I have been dating since February  She s always been very confident and outgoing and these are traits that I admire in her but also lack myself  Therefore  sometimes Tessa will have to push me out of my comfort zone when we do things  For example  she s the reason we re dating   I initially turned her down because I was very closeted  But she managed to convince me and we re very happy together   Sometimes I feel like she pushes too far and I didn t really have an issue with it until the week before last  We had been at a get together at one of her friend s houses  There were   of us all just sitting around playing cards against humanity and chatting  At some point her friend raided his father s liquor cabinet and started making us drinks  After this the night becomes a bit of a blur for me   I don t think I drank that much but I m a lightweight and was feeling lightheaded  I do remember  being embarrassingly clingy towards Tessa though  e g  not letting her get up and leave the room when she was trying to give our Uber driver directions to the house    I don t remember the drive but we ended up at Tessa s house and I remember waving at her older brother while she was steering me towards her room  It wasn t uncommon for me to sleep over at her house because my mother works odd hours  she s a nurse  and usually isn t home at night   We made out on her bed for a bit but I wasn t really into it because I was still pretty dazed  I felt her start to slip her hand down my pants and pushed it away  I was a little shocked because we hadn t really done anything below the belt before but I didn t dwell on it too much because she respected my wishes and stopped even if she did pout a little   It was past midnight at this point but the next day was a school holiday so we just changed into our pyjamas and cuddled while watching The Umbrella Academy on Netflix  I loved Robert Sheehan in Misfits and I started commenting on how similar his character was in TUA when I felt her slip her hand under my shirt and start stroking my stomach  It really felt nice and I started leaning into her  which is where I think I fucked up    Tessa sat up and moved so she was straddling me and started kissing down my neck  I told her to stop and tried push at her shoulders although both were a bit halfhearted  Then she hooked her fingers around the waistband of my shorts and I remember asking her what she was doing  to which she replied   trust me   Then she pulled down my shorts and I started panicking and told her to stop   more firmly this time  She ignored me and started going down on me but it just made me freak out more    I tried pushing her again and said  Tessa  stop   But she wouldn t listen to me and I didn t want to yell and risk waking up her parents  So I tried to pull away but she was holding me down at the hips and wouldn t budge  Tessa s not overweight by any means but she s a basketball player and is about   inches taller and    pounds heavier than me so I really couldn t get away unless I tried hurting her  which I would never do  So I just let her continue and she did until I came  I don t know whether it was due to the alcohol or the embarrassment but I just started sobbing as soon as she finished pulling my shorts back up  She immediately began hugging me and telling me every was okay and that she loved me but that just made me cry harder   I excused myself to go to the bathroom and locked myself in there  Thankfully she didn t try to follow me  I must ve spent a good hour in there  showering in hot water and crying my eyes out  I m kind of ashamed to admit it because I still don t completely understand why I was crying  And I didn t feel better after it or my shower   just very  very tired  I also changed into my clothes from the previous day because I couldn t bear to put my pyjamas back on   Tessa was already asleep by the time I got back  but I knew I wouldn t be comfortable sharing a bed with her after what had happened  So I found a spare blanket and curled myself up in it on her window seat  I didn t think I d fall asleep but I did and the next time I woke up was to the sound of Tessa s brother banging on the bedroom door  yelling that there was breakfast if we wanted any  I heard shuffling on the other side of the room and turned so I could see Tessa  We made eye contact and she looked a little confused but I tried to smile at her  I don t know if it was very convincing   She asked me if I was coming downstairs with her and I croaked out a yes  which was honestly more than I thought I could manage after all that crying  She looked concerned and I felt incredibly guilty so I rushed up to her and we started walking downstairs  It was a bit past   so her parents were already at work  Tessa spent most of her time eating and chatting with her brother while I sat listening to them talk and fed their dog bits of bacon  At one point her brother commented on how quiet I was being and I tried to laugh it off  Tessa said something about me being tired but then  without any warning  put her hand on my shoulder and I couldn t stop myself from flinching  Her brother raised an eyebrow and Tessa looked hurt but I tried to fix things by agreeing that I was tired   I haven t been able to be physically intimate with her ever since  Not just kissing and stuff but I can t even stop freaking out when she brushes against me or pokes me to get my attention  which is ridiculous because she s my girlfriend  But I can t stop myself from reacting the way I do and don t know how to fix this   Of the two friends I told about what happened  one said to give her time and the other said to break up with her  I don t want to break up with Tessa   I love her  And what happened wasn t her fault  She could ve misinterpreted the mood  especially with the way I was clinging to her at her friend s house and leaning into her while we were in bed  There s also the nature of our relationship to consider   with her constantly having to push me out of my comfort zone  which I m normally grateful for  And she didn t even expect me to reciprocate after she went down on me   she just wanted to make me happy  So I definitely don t want to break up with her  But nothing s changing   it s been two weeks and I still start hyperventilating any time she touches me   So  fellow Redditors  please tell me what to do  Please tell me how to fix this 
785,0,Me    M  and my girlfriend    F  are going to a destination wedding for a part of her family with fairly different political views  and my GF has trouble coping Her family is pretty close  however the part of her family that lives in Florida  including the new in laws of her cousin  her cousin  and her cousin s soon to be husband  are pretty hardcore Trump fans  GF and I are more liberal dem    When the drinks start settling in  politics gets brought up inevitability and my GF gets pretty upset about it in the moment as there are heated discussions about everything from gun control to immigration and Trump himself    I personally don t care that much in the moment  we don t see them much but they re otherwise cool people we get along with well  I don t think I ll change their minds in the few times a year that we see them  so I don t try  I just want to drink and shoot the shit   this goes well for me and them  because regardless of political divides we all just like to be happy and have fun   What I m wondering about are any coping or prepping techniques I can discuss with the GF before we go  so she doesn t take it so personally in the moment  she s an inner city teacher of poor immigrant kids in middleschool  so she we have a different perspective   Have any of you dealt with an SO who gets like this about politics with family  What did you do to help

788,0,Is she still interested in me So I have been talking to this girl    f  and we have met up twice both times we kissed each other  Each night was amazing and we had great chemistry  Me    m  being in the military I was getting deployed and we said we can make it work which it was fine for a month  We kept texting each other we missed one another and sending these    But one day she posted a photo on instagram and she said  I m just a girl but I want to be your girl   I got excited and asked her if it was about me she didn t reply  I didn t think much about it until two days later I said is she still interested she asked if it was about the post I said yes and no she s like no I m talking to anyone else and I m not seeing anyone  I didn t believe her at the time so I ask is that true she said I can believe what I want to believe  Eventually she tells me what do expect we re not really together we re not dating  Then i called her she just said she s doesn t know why I m angry and I cannot control her like her ex did  You see she likes to compare me to ex negatively like you sound like him and your acting like him  Any ways my emotions are high and she blocks scared I ll lose her forever I kept making accounts on Snapchat to see why she was mad at me eventually she called me psycho which I admit I was acting like a weirdo but I was like can you give me a couple days to think she said yeah   Two days go by and I text her back apologizing for what I d do and I said can we talk again and take things slow so we can figure out what we want she said yes   So I started by texting her like a friend and she really didn t engage she just said okay and sure and mhmm eventually I asked does she want to be with me in the the future she said idk do you still like me and again idk do want this to work idk again  Today I texted her I missed she said awe and I sent her a blushing face she sent    I thought we were finally getting it to work and then we had an small argument after that we kinda made up but didn t i told her that she was cute and she thanks I sent her a blush I said always    Then she sent   I apologized and said old habits die hard she said okie I sent another blush then sent a photo of her and her cousin  Idk what to think anymore is she still interested me or what cause I m at a loss I need some outside input 
789,0,I    F  am worried a relationship with an ex FWB  M    who is now divorced will be poisoned from the startFour years ago  I had a purely sexual relationship with a man who was married at the time  I manipulated him in various ways to cause strain in his relationship with his wife and his children  Eventually his marriage fell apart and he was in a dark place for a while  especially when I broke things off with him as well  I m a different person now  as is he   He contacted me recently and we ve been going on occasional dates but no sex yet  He has had a lot of time to reflect and tells me he is ready to start the next relationship chapter in his life  especially now that his kids are in high school and fairly independent  He has long forgiven me for my part in the failure of his previous marriage  He is really interested in a relationship with me    He s in a good place now  financially and I think emotionally  Has my complicated history with him poisoned any possibility of a healthy relationship moving forward    TL DR  Not sure if my history with an ex FWB has jeopardized my chances of a healthy relationship with him  
790,0,Me    Her   Recently i have really become close friends with this girl i have been friends with for most of my life  I have known this girl since my first day of school in primary school Kindergarten in America  and have grown up with her my whole life  I only just recently got into her and i m not sure if she feels the same way as i do  I would go and ask her out however      If she doesn t feel the same way as i do and if she rejects me i don t want her to not be friends with me anymore because she thinks i m a creep or whatever       One of my other closest friends despises her and hates her  I wouldn t want to loose one of my best friends as my that friends might go talking about me to my other friends as we are in one big friendship circle  I really don t want to loose this friend as she is someone i go to in hard times and loosing her might make me loose myself      i would just not care and just be friends with her however i feel jealousy might get the most of me if she goes out with another boy  I know i won t be able to cope with the jealousy and will stop talking to her or hate her  what i really don t want to happen   I really need some help with this and maybe someone in the same situation who has figured it out can help me  
791,0,My    f  BF    m  Is Too CaringThrowaway  And yes  I know this sounds stupid   When I first met my boyfriend I was not a confident person  I didn t know what I liked and what I didn t  I didn t know how to say no  I didn t know how to say  no   It caused some problems  especially where sex was concerned   It was bad  I won t go into detail but I thought I had a rape fantasy and it turns out I didn t  I didn t blame him but he was afraid to touch me for weeks  I don t blame him for that either      In those two years he helped me discover a lot about myself and we learned a lot about each other  I know what I like and what I don t and I know how to convey it  I m comfortable with myself  my sexuality and with him    The problem is  he doesn t recognize that  He ll ask me before he touches me in any way that s more than a hug  he doesn t initiate much and when he does it s super gentle  if I m not up for sex and he needs it he ll masturbate instead of asking me for a blowjob because he s afraid I wouldn t say no if I didn t want to       I ve talked to him  but he says he can t be comfortable unless he knows I m comfortable and he s not there yet     I m past that  I want him to tell me when he wants sex  I want him to pull my clothes off and push me onto my knees and I want him to be comfortable doing it  The only times he s ever done anything I didn t like it was my idea in the first place  and I d tell him no if I didn t like it    How do I get him to relax about the sex things 
792,0,Was I    f  manipulated by my ex    m  TLDR at bottom  Might be nsfw  better safe than sorry  While I am not in a relationship with this person anymore  I stay in contact with him and I want to know if this is something serious and I should cut him off  We did not see each other in person that often so it would be classified as a long distance relationship  First  it was sexting which was fine with both of us  But then  he would start pushing me to talk over the phone  At first I was uncomfortable but after a while I was ok with it  Then  he pushed me over FaceTime  It always went like this    Him   makes a casual joke   is this the part where we take off our clothes     Me   laughs and deflects    Him   but for real I really want to see you    Me   why     Him   because you re hot and I want to see you    Me   I don t really feel like it  sorry    Him   sighs   ok  I guess I ll just cry myself to sleep    Sometimes at this point the subject would be dropped because it would be presented as a joke or lighthearted banter  Most of the time  though  it progressed  He would beg to see me because he missed my face  body  smile  whatever  I would always ask like  why do you want that   And he would shower me with compliments  I would repeatedly tell him that I don t want him to see me  The reason for this is because I have a lot of insecurities regarding my skin and would feel very uncomfortable showing my face  When I would bring that up  he would back down for a little bit  but it would always come up later in conversation  He would tell me to  just take off my shirt  but I could keep my bra on  After resisting for a while I would eventually give in  But that wasn t enough for him of course  He would then convince me to take off my bra  and do stuff for him because it would make him feel good  I always felt a pit in my stomach when I did this kind of stuff    My problem is that some small part of me enjoyed it  I loved him and would do anything for him  I trusted him and if he felt good then I felt good  After we were done and we hung up for the night  I would stay up for another hour or so just thinking about what happened and why I had done the things I did  I always felt so ashamed of myself and the feeling of guilt would follow me into the next day  He is very Christian and the morning after he would usually send a long text about how he felt bad and regretted it and swore that that would never happen again  It always did happen again  right until we broke up  Now that I m looking back on the relationship  those instances always make me feel uneasy  Am I just feeling regret  It was I taken advantage of  If this sounds like manipulation I plan to cut off contact immediately   TLDR  My ex would push me into phone sex  I was stuck between legitimately enjoying it and dreading it  was he manipulating me

795,0,My first date after boyfriend s suicideJust over five weeks ago  the guy   M  I   F  had been dating for a month committed suicide  It came as a complete surprise  It s honestly been the hardest thing I ve ever had to go through  Though we had only dated for a month  we spent every single day together  and I had already met his parents  After getting the opportunity to tell his parents about our month together after he passed  I felt better knowing at least the people who also loved him knew he had happy last days  I m someone that loves to document everything via photo video  so I got to share photos of him smiling  etc  that I know they loved  A huge part of grieving for me was writing  I wrote how I was feeling  wrote about stories from when we were together  and even wrote about the meaning behind the tattoo I got to memorize him   I figured it was worth mentioning this is one of many tattoos I have   At the viewing and funeral  I met     who came up and personally thanked me for what I had posted because it gave them a look a him living a happy life and a side of him that they otherwise wouldn t have known  Because of this response  all these posts are marked as public   Fast forward to now  I ve grown very close with his family and some friends  I joined Bumble alongside my roommate  Because I was so public about grieving  I intentionally didn t link my Instagram  I met someone that I ve really enjoyed talking to  and after texting for a couple days  we made plans to go out on Friday  I do feel ready for this  however  I m nervous about this topic somehow coming up  My date moved to the area under a year ago  and to my knowledge we have no mutual friends  I have a pretty popular name  so it d be kind of difficult to find me on social media  However  he works in marketing so I can imagine he ll find me sooner than later  So while I don t imagine it d come up right away or even on the first date  I m looking for advise on when to address this sort of thing if even at all  In no way am I ashamed of what has happened  It s incredibly sad and unfortunate  but I know I can t change anything and would like the opportunity to move on without shocking any potential chance of that with what s happened

797,0,Me     M  can t believe gf    F  did not sleep with that friend she slept over at his house  Will women ever confess sleeping with someone while in a relationship Long story short  my gf of that time had urges to go out alone and all that   i did not say anything of it    Then suddenly one day she tells me she is gonna stay over at a friend    I did not want to sound controlling so i let her be  she comes next day and whenever i confront her asking if she slept with him she says no    I broke up with her simply because every time i remember this i get crushed    She kept denying it till the last breath   Saying they talked and then she slept on the couch  she had a fight with me that day     So my question is   is it out of ego or something to deny sleeping with someone  as a woman  do you even confess sleeping with someone or you will never do that  because this whole situation sounds really clear she did   TLDR  Gf stays the night at some guy friend house  gets the other day and swears she did not sleep with him  should or shouldn t i believe her

802,0,To leave or not to leave  that is the question   I  f    married my husband  m    last year even though I had doubts  We dated for   years before I agreed to marry him  The only reason I agreed is because I had been wanting to get married for years  but he said and did things showing me he was not ready  To give some history about why I regret jumping into this  After college graduation  I left my pretty cushy job on a whim because he got into law school in a different city  I followed to the new city where I found a low paying job until I told him I couldn t take it anymore and went back to get a second bachelor s degree  He helped me financially  but placed restrictions on what I could could not spend money on since he was paying for rent  which he had to do regardless for himself   I paused my life after we graduated  and I moved in with my parents in my hometown while we waited for his bar results  I substitute taught because my significant other  SO  had no real plans  All of the aforementioned  moving with my parents substituting  was at his behest  He passed the bar  but during this time  about a year  we lived apart  with our respective parents in two separate cities   After a year or so  I got tired of living in a temporary job state  and I found a pretty good teaching job  The gig was easy and not very demanding  I liked it enough  My SO found a job as well in a small  far away border town  He loved it  We lived apart for another year  During this year  he cheated on me on   separate occasions with   different women all within a month s time span  His explanation was he panicked because I wanted to move forward and get married  What made the process so difficult is he never just came clean to me  I had to put on my  private investigator costume  and catch him in his web of lies  I decided after much thought to stick it out after the tumult of the cheating  A year and a half later  he calls me during the the weekend before thanksgiving and tells me he thinks it would be worthwhile to get married  I thought he was just being a jerk  so I hung up on him  He called me back and said he was serious  I told him if he wanted this then I wanted an engagement ring  He told me to pick it myself and gave me his credit card  He sucked all of the romance and enjoyment out of the engagement  He did the same with the wedding ceremony and reception  We got married during a work day at the courthouse  We only had a reception   months later because our families were disappointed they weren t invited the the courthouse ceremony  He sucked the joy out of the reception by complaining about helping  and inviting people that didn t matter much to him  This put pressure on me because we were limited on funds and I had to be the jerk to tell some of the random people he invited that their spouses were not invited  People were not happy with me  It was embarrassing and awkward  After our reception  all he did was complain that we shouldn t have done it  and we needed to pay it off ASAP  Also  he complained it got too expensive   It was expensive because of all the random people he invited   If we had kept it intimate like I wanted  it wouldn t have cost so much  Anyway  more recently we ve been arguing over my going back to school  I burnt out from teaching  He told me I couldn t go back because we still owed for our wedding reception last year  When I told him student debt is not terrible and we could handle it  he freaked out and threw in my face that he only had grad school loans  no undergrad debt   I have lots of undergrad debt  His parents used to be wealthy  My parents are working class and have always been in debt  but managed to make ends meet  They are happy people that live simple lives  I m not sure if his parents were ever really happy even with all their money  A week after our argument about me going back to school  when things had calmed   my SO mentions how since we discussed issues previously in the week he wanted to bring up our lack of connection during sex as an issue  Honestly  my SO is terrible in the sac  He always has been   I had several partners before him  and he s been the worst at pleasing me because he doesn t listen to my suggestions and just wants to have  vanilla  sex  His idea of mixing it up is anal  I m not a big fan of anal  but I do like rough sex  He makes me do anal  but he s  uncomfortable  being rough though  I just feel let down by my decision to marry someone who is so self centered  I also just feel like an idiot for falling for his apologies and empty promises to change  I just worry that I m staying because of the fear of starting from scratch  I also fear that I won t find anyone worthwhile at this age  Btw  we don t have children  I just don t know what to do      TL DR  My husband is selfish  but I don t know if I should or how to break free of the relationship  We have no kids  I just am seeking advice from people that have experienced this

806,0,I want to get back with my Ex after   years of being a part  am I crazy So  this is long   I started dating a girl my freshman year of college and I instantly fell in love  We had a lot of great times and I thought that she was going to be the person I spent the rest of my life with  Well  after dating for two and a half years  we were living together but she wanted to take a break  Being young and dumb and instead trying to work through the issues at the time  I obliged  Well we had a Ross Rachel situation with me being Rachel and her being Ross    I considered this cheating and confronted her about it and she admitted that she was sleeping with someone else  I asked her whether or not this was the only occurrence of infidelity and she said yes this was it  Comes to find out  she lied to me and I broke up with her  She ended up getting pregnant the month after we broke up to the guy who she was cheating on me with    That was four years ago  She ended up breaking up with her son s father and has been dating on and off since  I have had a tenuous relationship with her over the last   years from meeting up and being friendly to blocking and not talking  Obviously  I still have feelings for her  She s in been in two major relationships since me and I haven t been in a relationship at all since her  I typically send her flowers on V Day and Birthday and I ve been known to send her gifts randomly  She recently asked if i could help her with money and i obliged   Recently  I started talking with her more and we arranged to go on a vacation together  While spending an extended amount of time with her  I realized that I wanted to get back with her   Now  here s the catch  she cheated on me by using Snapchat and thus I have some trust issues  These trust issues caused me to make a mistake and look through her phone without her knowing  I know I m a terrible person  and I saw that she was talking to other guys and sending pics to guys while we were together  To her credit  we aren t exclusive and so it s not really problem    After the vacation  I confessed what I had done and profusely apologized and she took it well  We talk pretty consistently but my own insecurities make me think that she s either focusing on someone else or seeing someone else besides me    So  here s my question  how do I build trust in her  How do i fight off my own insecurities  Is there any way to tell whether she s using me just for emotional support and materials things without wanting to seek a relationship    Feel free to comment on anything and ask questions for more info   Thanks friends 
807,0,I     F  recently left an abusive relationship  in a new relationship with M     and Im not sure if this is normal behaviourI was in a relationship with a physically and psychologically abusive man for   years and that was my first and only relationship    months have passed since I broke that off and   months ago I met this new guy and we have been together since  Im happy because hes not agressive and at least for now he has not put me down in any way  but I have a worry which might be stupid  He wont like any of my pictures on instagram or facebook while he likes almost every recent picture of all girls he follows  He isnt the type of guy that just  is not into social media   He is actively posting following liking and commenting  I see him liking other girls pictures all the time  Im getting paranoid because I am scared that Im not good enough or pretty enough for him  Everything that my ex has been telling me for the past   years is coming back to haunt me and Im not sure how to deal with this  Ive told my boyfriend that Im not comfortable with him liking so many instagram pictures of beautiful girls because it makes me insecure and paranoid about getting cheated on again and not being good enough but he brushed it off by just saying that he  gets  it but its not that serious  and continued doing what hes doing   TL DR  My boyfriend likes every girls pictures except mine  told him it bothers me and got brushed off  not sure if this is normal behaviour because I have never had a healthy relationship  
808,0,Need some help with a girl I m a junior in HS  Been getting to know this girl in a few of my classes recently and she s a really cool person  She s popular  and gets a lot of guys  attention  She goes to get coffee or the movies or whatever with a few guys as  friends   She s not necessarily a hoe  but she likes the attention I think  She s kinda out of my league  but agreed to get coffee with me this weekend  How can I go about being more than just another  friend  she hangs out with and get into a relationship with her  Also  should I be worried about her other  friends   
809,0,Issue with a bf  m     I promised never to bring up exes again after initial argument but asked for a pass to talk about certain friend request on Facebook   F     Is this letter okay Writing a letter  well texting a letter  to my bf  Can I get some thoughts  I don t want to come off like I want a break up    or be too harsh   Here it is   You seem to me to be stuck in your perspective of things  whether they are true or not  and that has negative consequences  We have to have understanding  on both ends  and I m always willing  but our relationship cannot work if it s only me trying to have understanding  There cannot be this lack of changeability in the way we communicate  We have to grow together in order to survive    What I am upset about is that you turned the conversation around on me  Trying to get me to feel some guilt about a very honest and real concern that I had instead of trying to understand it  You just shut down and put the issue all on me  Saying you re disappointed in me  For what  Having feelings  Wanting to make it work  Making sure we can be honest with each other and not get weird about an ex  whom really shouldn t matter  I asked you for a pass bc it was something that came up in my face again  and it needed to be addressed in a mature way  and I was honest and vulnerable  and I shouldn t have to feel guilty for that  There wasn t any mean words or threats  or ultimatums  You know that that isn t my style  There was no need to try to make me feel guilty in that situation when I asked for a safe space to talk   I know that it was okay for me to bring this up  Being friends with an ex is one thing  but having an ex publicly write on Facebook about how much she loves your child with hearts  posting videos of you sitting on her bed with your daughter with hearts  and calling you relationship nicknames still  like Lu  and you calling her blue   years after you ve been together is not respecting either of your new or future relationships  She hasn t seemed to do this in a while  but I am still allowed to have that concern  especially when she recently asks to be your friend again and you tell me that you guys frequently text    It s not about the fact that I don t trust you  I m trying but because of our issue with the distance  things may need to be reiterated sometimes as I don t get that in person reassurance and trust me every woman who starts to really like a man would understand what I m saying  I m not a statue  My emotions aren t rock  and I won t allow myself to be walked over or made a fool of    I needed to know and understand that you have honestly removed yourself from her and you said you had  but why the nicknames and hearts and from what you re telling me  constant texts  You both should have moved on from these flirty emotions  no   I know that I m not immature  nor needy  nor untrusting  What I see hurts me  only because I like you and you may think from your perspective that you ve told me everything  but you haven t  and feeling like I can t ask questions without you getting either quiet or angry only adds stress and uncertainty to our relationship   You may be mad because you think that entire   hour conversation was about the friend request  but it wasn t  There was a lot that I needed to clear up and her friend request was only a part of my feelings of unsettlement  This wasn t about her  This was about us  and if you re prepared to not allow flirtiness from exes come around in the future in order to respect OUR relationship  I ve always respected my exes  Even though I may be friends with them  I don t get too friendly with them bc I respect whomever they may dating  and they do me  And maybe you guys are at a good place  and it s harmless  but how can I know for sure if you don t say it calmly and collectively  you getting stiff and raising your voice actually enforces feelings of unsettlement towards this  I m not telling you how to act or behave but I am wondering why you don t have a response where you d like me to feel comfortable      how does it sound 
810,0,Why does it bother me that my boyfriend likes other girls going out instagram picturesI really don t have any reasons to be insecure but somehow I am in this situation  On new years eve   my boyfriend stayed at my place for like   days and when he would go out with my dog  I would go on instagram and see that he liked almost every picture of dressed up girls in thiny dresses and stuff  I told him that it bothers me because he is sleeping right next to me for   days  I cook for him and take care of him   he was sick at the time  and he is going on instagram and liking other girls  He apologized to me because I explained to him that I feel really bad when I see it and now I noticed that he liked a picture of that same girl he did back then in her dressed up edition  I don t really know should it bother me or not but I somehow feel disrespected cause we talked about it  And he is the type of guy that is liking like every picture of every girl and I think it s really strange but don t know should I stress about it  Relationships are so hard these days with instagram and other crap  I just really want to go to   s and love some without any insecurities about our relationship 
811,0,Me    F  and my boyfriend    M  clock in at opposite ends of the family affection spectrum and I don t know how to work with itWe ve been together for   years  and last Christmas I finally put my foot down on activities with his family    During the   years we ve been together  I made a serious effort with his family  stopping by to visit  texting his mom  going to his brother s football game  etc  I was never very comfortable with it because my family is apparently distant  more on that later  and his family is super close  but it was bearable until his dad moved back in with his mom  It s already weird because they ve been divorced for many years and have no romantic relationship  but his dad is nasty  I mean  sexist  racist  and to me  physically repulsive  The little brother who is twelve still sleeps in his mom s bed  the entire family walks around in their underwear all the time  the house is always trashed  I m talking animal feces left on the floor for weeks  and the whole situation is awful for me    My family is extremely conservative and doesn t show much emotion  I think the last time either of my parents hugged me was before I was a teenager and we haven t said I love you in probably    years  I feel like I have a great relationship with my parents and family  no resentment here at all  I ll check in via text or phone call every few months and sometimes we ll get together for lunch or something if everyone happens to be free and in the area  I put no pressure on my boyfriend to hang out with my family  and he never has except when he s with me  During his deployment  I was at his mom s nearly every week   My problem is that my boyfriend expects a lot more of me when it comes to his family  He practically worships his mother  who is mediocre at best  respects his dead beat dad out of some misplaced form of loyalty  and wants me over there all the time  His mom is manipulative and always guilting him over me not showing up to family breakfast  even though sitting at the table listening to his dad s sexist jokes and trying not to throw up while he eats and talks with no teeth is horrible for me  She makes all these nonsense little plans all the time and expects us to be there  It s gotten much worse since I put my foot down on Christmas and said I wouldn t be back there  I haven t been back since and his mom is guilt tripping him HARD   Recently  this almost destroyed our relationship because we began talking about what his parents roles in the life of our future baby would be    My question is   does anyone else have experience with this  I m trying to find a middle ground that we can both agree on     Also  let me add that my boyfriend loves my family and likes being around them  I tried a  you don t have to see my family if I don t have to see yours  but he and my dad get along great  My dad is more of a dad to him than his own father

815,0,My sister     asked me     to be her MOH and I m having trouble dealing with her over the top prissy bridal party which I am far from personality wise  How do I pursue this without causing any trouble Long story short  my sister got engaged to her long term bf of   years just over a month ago   I couldn t be happier for her and I absolutely love her fianc  my future brother in law  Our families couldn t be more different though  which I already knew might be an obstacle attempting to plan a wedding together  His family is very traditional orthodox  large family  very traditional European from the old country type  A great bunch that I ve always gotten along with in passing  Just really oriented in their own ways which is far from my direct family  We re more laid back and just go with whatever type of people but obviously we have values and traditions of our own just like everyone else    The first days after she was engaged she asked me to be her maid of honour and I obviously said yes  She s my only sister and I was thrilled to take on this with her as I have no idea if I ll ever have the honour of doing this ever again  I was worried at first as I ve never even been in a bridal party before but I have faith in myself as I m pretty good at organizing  helping and being there so I knew I could handle whatever came my way   turns out maybe I can t    Since day   wedding stuff has been real overwhelming  She has maybe     ppl coming from her side and he has over      Everything is very over the top that has been planned thus far and I know my sister has never been about anything like this and isn t this kind of person  My parents are starting to get really upset as his family will not allow my sister to be walked down the isle by my dad or have her dance with him along with other things that aren t part of their tradition religion etc  My father hasn t been doing well health wise the last few years and my mother is worried he may not get this chance again  His family has completely taken over the wedding planning and doing everything their way completely looking past our values and traditions  It s really upsetting to my family parents and close friends involved in the wedding on our side  And everyone comes to me to complain because what else are they to do I guess  We have a group chat with the bridesmaids and any input I say gets completely shut down  ignored or battered  It s gotten to a point where anything I do with the bridal party which consists of myself  one of my sisters close friends and the rest are his  family members  I feel like a loser even saying anything  I m completely out numbered and I can tell my sister is overwhelmed frustrated but just follows suit to keep her future husbands family happy  Not to mention no other bridesmaids have lifted a finger to do anything to help but are real great at making demands  I ve already spent hundreds helping for the wedding and done a lot of organizing to help my sister out for the shower and other things  I work   part time jobs and have my own shit as well so it s getting to be a lot   A few weeks ago we looked at bridesmaids dresses and anything that didn t have some bougie ass name on it was garbage to the bridesmaids on his side of the family  Eye rolls and complaints all day  Was hard to bite my tongue because my sister found some beautiful  and more affordable  dresses for all of us and they just kept bitching about how they weren t some brand name  In the end she got the dresses she wanted but people definitely gave her a hard time and weren t happy with the outcome  It was hard to watch and I just wanted to yell  it s not your wedding    I feel terrible because yesterday I kind of lost it on my sister after she embarrassed me in front of the bridal party while I was attempting to plan her bachelorette party  Everyone in the bridal party wanted to go away to Vegas and although I can t really afford it and I know my sister is struggling with this giant wedding coming up financially  I somehow managed to organize a trip with some cheaper options to try and keep everyone happy  My sister even admitted that it was too much and she didn t even want to go there in the first place but everyone in the bridal party was super pushy  I was then shut down again and frowned upon as if I was some ghetto person trying to set us up on some shit trip which I thought seemed pretty luxurious but I guess the only acceptable answer is the most expensive hotel and the most exquisite things to do  I felt super embarrassed and I don t know how to speak stand up for myself and my side of the family without pissing anyone off  offending anyone or doing any damage and making my sister unhappy  But I m getting real close to doing something like losing my temper with any more of these situations     I told my sister I m sick of getting disrespected and she needs to stand up for what she wants in HER wedding  She got really upset and we re not talking now  I feel so bad because I know my job is to help her with the load and do anything I can to help things run smoothly through this whole process and I feel like I did just the opposite  Am I being selfish  How do I go about this without doing anymore damage that I ve already done  I don t know how to incorporate my family s values and traditions into anything without his family getting upset as their way EXACTLY seems to be the only way  I liked his family before and have always gotten along with them but I m really starting to resent them and it s hard to see my sister get pushed around and my family get upset for getting shoved aside    I Need some serious advice because I ve never been good with confrontation and whenever it happens it s always a shit show when I finally get the balls to express myself

818,0,The constant battle between me and my mother  What is she gonna do when I finally move out for good Some back story My mom and I have had a bit of a stretched relationship ever since I moved away for college and came back to save up for a place of my own  which is happening in like   weeks  before my older sister moved out she would give my mom massages cause she is a nurse and has weight issues due to medical reasons  I always make the joke  your body is trying to petrify  because of how many knots she has in her muscles and how tough they are to deal with  Now that my sister has moved out she is seemingly constantly asking if I will do it   times outta    I do  She also has a toddler right now and another on the way   That bit is important   Now I had to take her to the hospital yesterday cause her and my dad had a severe stomach flu and since shes pregnant it hit her harder and more dangerously  I went to my boyfriends house for the night like I do every week  I wake up to her saying  I ll risk catching your cold  I m sore from yesterday   shes pregnant and too sensitive for me to actually get anything done  not to mention IM NOT A PROFESSIONAL  Youd think as a medical professional she d be a little more aware  But anyway it s not her  risking a cold  I dont want the fucking stomach flu cause I cant miss that kind of work  Like I LITERALLY cannot afford to  Both me and my dad are always telling her you needed a professional to deal with this cause me being the twig I am  I cant even get them to loosen all the way  It s a bandaid solution and right now it s a toxic one  Am I being unreasonable or should I put my foot down 
819,0,I hate that my girlfriend smokes weedI started dating a girl not too long ago and so far things have been going great  She has a great personality  she s smart  she s pretty  Honestly most of every thing I ve wanted in a significant other  Unfortunately there s one thing that s really bringing me down in the relationship  I don t like that she smokes weed  I don t smoke weed for the most part  Once in a blue moon at most  But she smokes all day every day and I don t think that s a healthy lifestyle in all honesty  I also don t like how she acts when she s high  Maybe it s me  but being around someone who s stoned when you re completely sober just isn t fun or engaging  Now the other day  I was in the car with her and her friend  They were smoking pot  while she was driving and honestly I didn t like it at all  She was having a hard time driving anywhere and almost caused two different accidents while doing so  I guess that was the point where I realized that this is an issue for me  I know I need to talk to her about my feelings  but I ve had a similar issue in a past relationship and my issue with her smoking weed only escalated the other issues in our relationship  The last girl I dated  who truly broke my heart  was a lot the same in this aspect  She was a good person who had some bad habits  more than just smoking weed  that killed the relationship  I had talked to her about my not liking her smoking all the time  I don t mind here and there  but truthfully can t stand it when you re high all day everyday  Unfortunately she just started hiding it better and lied to me about it instead  I truthfully would have preferred her to just say she wasn t going to quit for me  And that helped to ruin our relationship  Now I m in a predicament about how to bring this up to my new girl because I fear she ll do the same thing to me  I know I m not a perfect person  I have some insecurity issues and have a lot of anxiety about people leaving me  I m just honestly lost at this point as what to do  Should I tell her my issue with her smoking and hope she doesn t do what the last girl did to me  Or should I just ignore my dislike and try to work past it  I feel like I might be overcontrolling if I ask her to stop doing something she enjoys  but I also feel like a good relationship comes from making some sacrifices on both sides  Am I in the wrong for wanting her to stop something she enjoys  Any advice or insight is helpful at this point  Thanks everyone
820,0,Should I write to my ex on his birthday The birthday of my ex is coming up in a few weeks and I don t know what would be appropriate   We were together for   years and broke up more than   months ago on relatively good terms  We were talking for a few weeks after that via chat but it stopped eventually  I had my birthday just a few months after we parted ways and he wished me happy birthday  through chat  even though we were not talking daily by that time   I know it shouldn t be a big deal but I don t want so seem like an asshole  I think it wouldn t make harm but I don t wish to be on speaking terms with him anymore and I have a feeling that he is also totally okay with it   I only wish happy birthday to people I speak with regularly and or consider them friends family members    We are both around     And again  I know it s not a major problem but I would be grateful for some advice    Sorry for the grammar  English is not my first language    Edit  I have an awesome boyfriend now  I m not sure if it changes anything as he wasn t involved when the breakup happened  so no cheating or anything  but always good to clear things 
821,0,My   m  girlfriend   f  wants to get surgery  I m not comfortable with that Disclaimer  I m not saying any of this just because I love this girl and she s my girlfriend  even though it may seem that way  I m simply taking my raw thoughts and adding my feelings to them   Saying it how I mean it  although it may get a bit cheesy at times  but don t let that fool you in to thinking it s just my emotions talking   I know exactly what I m saying and normally I d keep it simple and to the point  but I ve actually found a girl worth expressing my feelings for for once   Not my first love  but hopefully my last    Except for food     My girlfriend always brings up how she wants to get lip injection  a boob job and butt implants   She think her upper lip is too invisible when she smiles  her breasts aren t big or perky enough and that her ass is flat and square shaped   I know I can t control her  but I can t say I support this for her   I have absolutely no idea where she got all this from though   She s fkn gorgeous  adorable and downright sexy all with her natural body   Not to mention she s an absolute genius in school and hilarious and fun to be around   She could easily get any guy she wanted with minimal effort   Low key why s she dating my boring average ass      Everyone s upper lip tends to thin out a bit when they smile  but here doesn t disappear  it looks totally fine and normal and she looks fkn adorable  she s very smol and innocent looking  but don t let that fool you  she low key a freak       Her breasts aren t huge  they re completely average and proportionate to her body like maybe B or C around  maybe in between    They re not saggy to the point where they look bad  they just have that tiny bit of natural drop like all breasts do  in fact I think they re pretty amazing and perky for natural breasts   She wants to at least get them lifted  I really don t think it s necessary at all and that she looks amazing   Her butt is absolutely god damn fucking amazing   We re both in to fitness and it shows   She s got a very fit  round  plump and full ass and a skinny waist  despite being an Asian girl not to be racist or anything  just cause most people from Asia are known to be skinnier    She has some crazy delusion that her thighs are too big  her hips are too wide and her butt is too flat and square   I honestly think that she s probably just caught up in all the social media and pop star trends with have huge fake butts  lips and breasts and skinny waists   To me  all that is absolutely disgusting  I hate how they all pop so much   How they get worse with age   How they feel fake   It s all unappealing and unattractive to me   I told her this and she doesn t understand why I feel this way   First it s cause her body is the body of my dream girl to be honest   Second is because I don t think she should get any surgery to make changes to her already perfect body when she can make  most  of the changes herself   She already goes to the gym pretty lightly and has developed a really nice physique  she clearly has good genetics   If she actually put in more effort to it  she d easily be able to get the ass she wants with the right workouts and nutrition   She can build up her chest a bit with some more upper body workouts with minimal breast fat loss and just strengthening and growing the muscle under to make it seem more perky like she wants she tends to skimp out a bit especially on chest and arms haha    Obviously lips aren t really something you can do much about naturally   I mean I guess I can learn to get over the lips if it s not a massive difference  but honestly her lips are totally fine in my opinion  nothing wrong at all and her upper lip doesn t disappear   Even so  if she did the rest  it s too much for me and I told her she should learn to love herself more  she s stunning and that there s nothing wrong with her  although whenever I do try to support her she thinks I m just doing it cause it s a boyfriends duty no matter what  even though I made it very clear to her from that start that I d only tell her the truth and what she needs to hear  never less and never what she just wants to hear   I m not sure she ll do it all  and I think it could just be a phase maybe cause of the whole media and her age and everything  she s very in to the whole world of the Kardashians and that dragrace show and jersey shore  etc   So needless to say her interests kinda surround her with all this drama and  change your body  kind of stuff    Not to mention that her mom isn t exactly the most supportive towards her  she doesn t really comment on her looks at all  but she always makes her feel like she s not good enough at anything  and I think that s what s affecting how she sees herself in almost every aspect  looks included    I told her that it makes me kinda uncomfortable  and it seems like she s taken that in to consideration  not      sure how much    She s also mentioned Botox for wrinkles in her old age  but I mean Asians don t get old till their fkn    lmao and even then I d appreciate be wrinkles   Not to be cheesy but to me most natural bodies are beautiful if properly taken care off  wrinkles  scars  marks and all the rest   It all tells a story and it s all a part of life   I don t want to grow old and wrinkly while my potential wife some day looks like the crazy lady that got surgery to look like a fkn cat lmao   Not to mention the message it d send to our kids one day if we get that far   If she actually does end up going through with all that one day  I m not so sure I could put up with someone so plastic and insecure when it comes their looks especially when they look as good as she does now  even though she claims if she did it I d probably love it  I guaranteed her I never could or would   I do however doubt that she would do this without me being comfortable with it   She really cares about my happiness as much as her own and she s so certain that I m the man she ll spend her life with  and honestly I think she could be the woman I ll spend my life with too since we get along so well together and balance eachother out so much   Even in the most dull moments  we enjoy eachother company  without even having to speak a word   She s my best friend I d have to say and it kills me that she can t understand how great she is  not just to me  but in general   TLDR  Beautiful girlfriend wants lots of surgery in the future  I m not quite comfortable with that   P S SORRY FOR ANY TYPE OF MISTAKE I WAS USING GOOGLE ASSISTANT FOR MOST OF THIS  also it s not guaranteed she wants to go through with this  and definitely not anytime soon  she sjust expressed very strong feelings about it  I think the thing that is making her hesitant towards it is me expressing how I feel about it   While I would never control her and tell her she s not allowed I do believe she s free to make her own decisions and do whatever she wants  I could also lever support just because of how much I don t like it   I am not a controlling more demanding boyfriend in any way  I try to treat my girlfriend with the upmost respect and nothing less   She has been nothing but good to me that s all I want to be to her   
822,0,I    F  am interested in my martial arts instructor    M  I ve had a crush on my instructor for awhile now  close to a year   During this time I ve tried to interact with him more and try to talk to him about common interests  I m pretty bad at this and mostly have just talk to him about martial arts    I m planning on asking him out  but I m not sure if it would be better to keep trying to casually talk to him during class more first  This way he knows me a little better and maybe would be more likely to agree to a date  Or is it better to just ask him out because I ve been trying this for months now and I m not making any progress it feels like 
823,0,Sex ProblemsSo my boyfriend    m  and I    f  have been together for almost a year  We are very much in love  and I would do anything for him  as he would for me    We have never had any issues  any big fights  nothing terrible  We both have lots of respect for each other which is a very nice thing  But I feel like for some reason out relationship is falling apart  But there s no reason for things to change    But  recently  I ve had an issue being intimate with him  He s very attractive and the connection is there  but I just can t bring myself to do it  I don t know why and it makes me sad because he thinks that I don t find him attractive or worthy enough    He always wants to have sex  and I feel bad if I tell him I m not in the mood for it because I m never really in the mood for it  I don t know if it s just my insecurities getting in the way of us sharing that intimate connection  but I m scared that it might turn into a huge issue    I work upwards of    hours a week  and when I get home all I want to do is relax  But a part of me feels bad    Is there anything I can do to help this situation  I don t know what solution their could possibly be  but I m looking for suggestions on what I can do  hopefully from people who have been in similar situations  Thanks
824,0,What would you do  Boyfriend s cat sleeps in the bed    Hello  What would you do  To the point     My boyfriend s cat sleeps in his bed and meows loudly during the night  walks on the bed  and keeps me awake  I can t seem to come up with a good solution to get good sleep when staying at his house   Also  I am medically treated for insomnia issues  so getting good sleep is like GOLD to me  I ve tried everything with this cat   I even bought her a cat bed so we could try to get her to sleep in another area of the house instead of on the bed with us  She meowed for an entire HOUR when we shut her out of the room       I just can t sleep with his cat     His solution is that I sleep in the guest room     OMG I just hate that solution  It makes me feel like     why does the cat get to sleep with him and I am relegated to the guest room      The other day I got annoyed at  am because the cat wouldn t stop meowing and he yelled at ME for being annoyed    I have tried everything with this cat and why do I get yelled at because his cat is behaving badly  I think it just doesn t annoy him as much       I just simply don t like animals in my bed  Does this make me a bad human  What can I do about this  How can I get better sleep at his house  I am seriously contemplating not staying over there anymore      Please help  Yes  she has plenty of food and water in her bowl and we ve also tried a squirt gun  I ve tried to give her tons of attention and wear her out   but let s face it     cats are nocturnal    The only other option I have at this point is just to not stay over there        amp  x   B 
825,0,My GF  F     and I  M     mutually broke up split due to a lack of quality time together from classes  I want to get back closer together over summer  but I don t know how to ask how she feels without things being awkward Wow this is long  sorry   Background  My  ex  GF and I are coworker RAs and we steadily got closer first semester of the year  Eventually she made the first move and asked me to come to her room  where I had my first kiss with her and a couple weeks later we lost our virginities to each other  It really felt like a fairy tale  We spent a lot of quality time together and talked a ton  I have depression  and take antidepressants  and mild Aspergers  and she often hugged me when I was crying form a hard day  Likewise I tried to comfort her whenever I could since she was often stressed due to her hard STEM major  We fucked like rabbits and enjoyed each other  and she definitely appreciated my willingness to make her happy in bed  and as much as I could outside of it  I loved making her laugh and smile  and everything felt pretty alright for a first time relationship    Fast forward to the beginning of this semester  after winter break   it felt like a switch had flipped  She seemed cold and distant  and we didn t talk as much as we used to  She s been constantly working in a lab as an undergrad to get her name in a couple papers for her PI  and is an undergraduate TA  Needless to say  she didn t have any time to do usual relationship things  She often complained about residents and the stresses of RA life and school work  Long story short is that we tried to take a break until summer started  but she soon decided that she didn t want to leave me hanging in hopes of starting up again since our next  last  year of undergrad would likely turn out the same way and then we would most likely go our separate ways     During the talk that we had where we broke up officially  I asked why she felt so distant and what I could do to make the relationship work  and she opened up to me about the stresses that the relationship brought  She said that she felt obligated to spend lots of time with me wanted to give us time together  which more often than not cut into her sleep  and she had a lot of   a m  s   which caused her a lot of mental strain  She s a very independent person and often needs time for herself to relieve stress too  She also said that when she was complaining about dorm life and how much she hated college food beforehand that she was secretly hoping that I would offer to go with her to get food off campus as a date  She also said that she didn t like washing the sheet constantly since we were often in her room  I told her that I had no idea that these things were bothering her and that I wish I had known that she wanted fair help with the bedsheets and to go out more like we used to  I told her that this feels like the first communication hurdle that we ve experienced and I offered to try and do my part in the cleaning  or have sex in my room  and that I d love for her to express things that I could do to make her feel more comfortable in the relationship since I had often expressed my wants and needs prior  She said that our love languages were very different  hers  quality time acts of service  mine  words of affirmation  and that since due to the circumstances  lack of quality time  she didn t have romantic feelings for me anymore  She said that she still thought that I was an awesome  funny  attractive guy but that things weren t working  She and I agreed to stay friends  and we still talk pretty extensively  but there is obviously a barrier between us romantically       Fast forward to Spring Break  and I still have feelings for her  They say that you ll know that you love someone when it hurts not to be able to  and I have to say that my heart ACHES  I ve had friends and coworkers advise to give her space over break and to not talk or text unless she initiates conversations to give us both time  and and it s been hard since I ve been in a different state all break so I haven t had the opportunity to bump into her  We re both going to be at the university over summer break  and her birthday is coming up  which will be stressful since her parents are traveling out and we have a big RA event  She s going out drinking with friends lab mates  and in the meantime I ve been thinking of going to clean her room  clean her coffee cups  and leave her a small present that she s been wanting  since she s expressed that one of her best stress relievers is coming home to a clean room  I want to be something more than friends  but I feel like putting a label calling ourselves a couple would just cause her more stress  I think that if we were a couple in all but name only  things would be great       I d love for some input from other women that browse  Should I do it  Do something else  Leave it alone  Give her more space  Offer to be friends with benefits  Write another novel long post that s too dry for any sane person to read      TL DR   GF and I mutually split up due to a lack of communication of wants and needs love languages being expressed caused by circumstances of busy college life and stress  We grew apart in second semester  and didn t have the ability to be romantic in a non sexual context  which led to her losing the spark that we used to have  Due to the time crunch that she had  she said that she felt super stressed from the relationship because we weren t able to spend time together  and that she would feel better if we could break away cleanly  She fervently expressed her desire to stay friends and to not leave on bad terms since  as she says  I m a great and funny guy and she loves hanging out with me  After some time apart  with radio silence  I want to do a romantic gesture for her by cleaning her room for her  which she loves  and giving her a birthday present that she s wanted for some time to help reduce her stress during the coming week of her birthday     Also I have depression and Aspergers and look way too much into irrational fears of mine  Also apologies for the formal rhetoric  comes with the territory of the Aspergers  P 
826,0,Should I bother my ex with friendship  Am I a horrible person  Did I ruin his life with my toxic behaviour So  first time poster  sorry for formatting   So sorry this is so long  but I feel like all the details are important to decide if I ruined his life and if I should just leave him be from this point    I was with with my ex  let s call him Dennis  for over two  I m     male  he s     male  This happened in the UK  The first year of our relationship was   perfect    We knew that we were meant to be together forever  Honest  healthy communication  care and affection and so much love  It was bliss   We split up last month because he went to visit a  friend   Marcus  and spent the weekend in his bed  Before this  I had told Dennis I was feeling uncomfortable with how often they were speaking  and that there were some messages being sent which were red flags   you re so cute  handsome    He assured me nothing was going on  he wanted   me   and I had to learn to trust him  I asked him to put some boundaries in place to ensure nothing untoward would happen  not sleeping in the same bed  or preferably not in the same room  not getting too drunk etc  He promised until he was blue in the face that he didn t like Marcus  Marcus didn t like him and nothing would happen   I spent the whole weekend feeling sick to my stomach because I already knew something had happened  Dennis told me that Sunday  I took a train all the way up to the North part of the country to see him  we were long distance  so we could talk  I knew I could never forgive him  but I desperately wanted to because I thought he was the love of my life   He then tells me the reason he did it was to break up with me  because he felt there was no other way to get rid of me  no other way that I would leave him alone other than to hurt me this badly  He also said that he wanted me to feel some of the pain he had been going through over the last few months   So here s where things start to get less clear cut   He said I made him feel like a failure  as a man  as a partner  as a student  He said I was constantly moody around him  making him walk on eggshells all the time  always focusing on my own issues and pain  and never caring about his  I also then blamed him for my bad moods  making him feel like everything was his fault and he was never good enough  I would refuse to communicate  using silence as a punishment  never admit when I was wrong  making it impossible for him to disagree with me because I would withdraw into a furious silence whenever he did so  and then constantly tell him he wasn t putting enough effort into the relationship  I made him feel like he had to put up with my behaviour to get any peace  And I got upset when we started having issues in the bedroom because I felt like it was because he didn t like me any more  Me being upset about it made him feel LIKE SHIT   All of this is of course awful behaviour  which I am so ashamed of myself for  I have now fully apologised for all of this  and will carry the guilt for the rest of my life  I know that doesn t make it ok  I can t believe I never realised that I was behaving this way  and never saw it  but communication really broke down between us and we never tried to talk to anyone else to get help   There was also a lot of stuff from him  he would put no time aside during the week to spend time with me  would snap at me for the tiniest things  take completely for granted that I did all the cooking and cleaning  never helped  and once almost broke up with me because he  thought he was straight   I honestly couldn t say who started behaving badly first  He was suffering from depression and went on anti depressants for a short period  I had no experience with anti depressants in any way and I took everything personally  he was constantly moody  upset  down  never complimented me or said anything nice to or about me  didn t want to do anything except play video games and go to work  which was really hard to deal with   Things started getting really bad when we moved in together into a flat my father owns  and shortly after  when Dennis was made redundant  he started working for my father  Dennis started feeling trapped and dependant on me and didn t said anything until months later  by which time he had started to act cold and distant  We got engaged a few months later  unbelievably stupid looking at it now  but obviously that made it worse   We started having arguments late into the night  and on one occasion I woke him up the night before an exam to continue to argue until  am  I don t know what I was thinking  and he was rightfully pissed  He flunked his exams that year badly  blamed me entirely for it  and decided to move back to his home town in order to finish his studies  at a better university but in a city he HATES  He tried at a few other unis in our city but didn t find anything which suited   When he got his exam results his demeanour suddenly changed  and he literally packed a suitcase and left halfway through a conversation  heading halfway across the country back to his parent s place  While he was there his dad got him an interview with the University of that city  which was the only offer he got and subsequently how he ended up back there  I knew none of this until several weeks later   I should also point out that a week before this he had gone off his anti depressants in order to  test  me  He had spent that week paying very close attention to me  spending lots of time with me  initiating sex  etc  so obviously I was overjoyed  I got my boyfriend back  But he told me that I only wanted him when he was off his medication  I told him  of course  I wanted him to be happy and healthy  and that I was only so happy this last week because he had been paying attention to me  I had had no clue he was off his meds  And that was when he walked out   And just before all of that  the cheating started  And  to be clear  I had cheated on him a few months in  I kissed and fondled a female best friend of mine  I am a gay man  It was entirely because I was scared of commitment and things seemed to be moving fast with Dennis  it was really stupid  but it happened  I told Dennis about it a month later  because I felt like I had been forced into doing stuff beyond kissing with this girl I just wanted it to go away   he was obviously upset I had waited for so long to tell him  but he forgave me and we moved forward  Later down the line  when he started spending all his time at work and coming home angry with me I also sexted a few people over sites like chat roulette just to feel wanted   Now the shoe was on the other foot  First  he fondled his best friend when he came over for a weekend  Then he kissed a co worker on a drunk night out  Then he spent moths sexting with someone I considered one of my closest friends  Then he started talking to an old friend  around the time he moved to his home city   So one day  after Dennis and I had had sex he started crying  saying that he had been thinking about someone else during it  that he loved them  and that we had to go on a break so he could figure it out  I was obviously devastated but followed my mother s advice  I told him to do what he wanted  as long as he didn t tell me  and I was willing to give it three months   Dennis experimented with this person  but that person wasn t comfortable and it ruined their friendship  obviously making Dennis feel worse  He came to visit  tells me he doesn t love me any more and we have to break up  The next day and start packing his things  He tells me I can t just forget about him  and I tell him I don t want to hear from him ever again  For me  once you re an ex that s it  He starts crying and says he never realised I was just going to cut him out of my life and wouldn t speak to him again  I start crying and saying that he really doesn t sound like he wants me out of his life   We give it two weeks  He goes back to his dads  He comes down and we spend a lovely weekend walking around our city  talking things through in the lovely summer sunshine  Eventually  we decide to give it another shot  We spend two weeks living together again and swinging wildly from being madly in love  telling each other we will be together forever  to him telling me he wants to break up  I started feeling sick from the whiplash of his emotions  that week completely broke my faith in his love for me  and I never really recovered from it   But we ploughed ahead  I started to recognise some of the toxic behaviours I had perpetrated  started apologising  and trying to be a better partner  But it was too little  too late  He was already pulling away  He kept making jokes about us breaking up or him sleeping with other people   I thought we had finally started getting back onto stable ground  even though Dennis was telling me that he didn t think the long distance relationship was working  I was confused  given that I felt like he wasn t really interested in being closer to me   Then that weekend with Marcus happened  I came up the day Dennis told me  and both of us said everything we had ever held back from each other  in a very calm way  admitting it was over but we might want to be friends  possibly friends with benefits  Then I stayed up all night with his father talking things through  really realised how toxic I had been  and wrote a letter to Dennis  knowing it was too late but that at least he knew I understood  at last  He started crying and said he would consider us being friends  He was cuddly  we had a  goodbye kiss  where sparks were flying  and I thought there was a chance at a reunion  Idiot that I am   Then I spoke to some of his friends  I was upset because Dennis had said that while he was sorry for the cheating he didn t regret it  and to me that didn t sound like an apology at all  They said nothing I could have done deserved that  I went over to his a drunken mess and told him that the cheating was really fucked up and that I felt like I had lost everything  He told me I ruined his life and that he didn t care what I had to say  I went back to the friends  place for the night  apologised to Dennis for my outburst  re iterated that my apology letter had been completely sincere  and we left it at that   I went to visit my family to lick my wounds  I spoke to my mother about everything  analysed the whole relationship and wrote another letter to Dennis  showing him what I had figured out as I thought it would help him  too He agreed with everything I had said  I prepared myself for my first day in over two years without talking to him  But then Dennis struck up a conversation   For a month I was over analysing everything he said because half the time he would be cute and cuddly  and half the time cold and distant  I tried not to push but secretly thought we were getting back on the path to getting back together  He had made plans in my city that weekend so we decided he would stay on the couch   The sexual energy was off the charts  I have never felt anything like it before  We talked about it and decided to have sex  figuring a friends with benefits situation could work because we were both desperate to have each other  It was amazing sex  and afterwards we were both very cuddly  he told me he loved me  I think it fucked up both of our feelings about each other really badly   We had been getting along fine as friends with minimal tension  plenty of flirting and just enough signs to make me think Dennis did still love me  because I was trying my best not to be the same toxic person  Trouble is  Dennis still was  He would push all my buttons to turn me into the bad guy  corner me in conversations where I could only choose to say something bad  constantly tell me I was a bad person and he couldn t forgive me  and then turn around and be totally cuddly with me the next second  I was going INSANE  I stopped eating  started smoking  drinking too much etc  it was nuts   I flirted with someone at a party  someone who had flirted with me when we were together  I told Dennis about it straight away at the time because I was uncomfortable and didn t want him to think anything untoward was going on  but it just made him super paranoid that something was going to happen between us   Dennis called me at midnight when he knew I was drunk after the party  found out about it  and told me he never wanted to speak to me again because he couldn t handle it  I was stunned  He had Marcus coming to visit THAT WEEKEND  and he thought he had the right to tell me I couldn t sleep with someone that had caused him emotional pain  He was acting passive aggressive and trying to force me into an argument  I refused to respond to it  and then he called me  Unlike our other arguments I didn t respond with emotion or self righteousness  I just listened until he got out what he had to say  then respectfully asked him to see the situation from my perspective  He apologised  agreed that he was out of line  and I felt positive that we had FINALLY had a difficult conversation not disintegrate into toxicity and lashing out   Then I flipped out when on the Sunday of that weekend he sent me a shirtless snapchat at  pm  clearly implying he had just had sex  I told him he was being insensitive and I didn t wanna talk to him  he snapped back that it wasn t like that and my friends helped me see how manipulative and controlling Dennis was being over the whole situation  We had a final video chat where we decided to take a break and start talking again after his exams in a few months  time   The first    hours were really tough  I talked to a therapist and arranged treatment to deal with my daily panic attacks  insomnia  etc  The next day was the first day I had had in weeks where I didn t wake up with an anxiety attack  and I realised it was because I was no longer talking to Dennis  I went out for drinks with a friend and he gave me some really life changing advice about Dennis  behaviour and why he was only keeping me around in his life to blame me for everything wrong in his life  I spoke to my friends and with their help drafted an email  I won t post it here because this story is long enough as is but essentially said to him in the nicest possible way  reminding him that it didn t excuse any of my awful behaviours  that he was holding double standards  and unless he was willing to treat me with respect  I didn t want to be friends  It was at that moment I genuinely got over him and saw no hope for any romantic or sexual future with him  But I did still care about him  I felt so guilty for what I had done to him  so I did want to be friends   He didn t react well  Sent an angry email back and called me to yell at me  But this time I had been coached by my friends  He lashed out to try and hurt my feelings to get me to respond emotionally and I didn t  He put me in a corner where I was an asshole for having a conversation late at night  but also an asshole if I wanted to save the conversation for another time  so I pointed out that it was unfair to put me that position where whatever I do I m wrong  we agreed on a time limit  I told him that he had to speak to me with kindness or I was done  And we had a very constructive conversation  We both apologised for everything we had done wrong  we both forgave each other  even though we knew neither of us could forget  and stayed up chattering away until     am  perfectly happy   Now we re back to talking as friends  I have started sort of seeing someone else  and have no designs on getting back together with Dennis  Dennis seems a lot happier in himself  is starting to rebuild his confidence  and seems a lot better  which is a huge weight off my mind  I know I still have a long way to go to continue dealing with the insecurities this relationship left me with  but I have no grudge against Dennis    amp  x   B   So after all this  should I just walk away and leave him be  Am I the one who should be shutting the door on his influence in my life  He says I did worse to him  did I    amp  x   B 
827,0,My sister     f  is mad that I used our brother s    m  deceased  name for my son  how do I fix this The skinny of it  my siblings are   and    years younger than me  and we have different dads  Three years ago  I moved back to my own father s home country     My brother passed away in an accident at age     I was four months along in my pregnancy when it happened  and absolutely heart broken  I still am   Recently  I gave birth  and the name of my child wasn t even a question to me  he would have my brother s first name as a middle  and only as a middle because I couldn t bear to use it all day long     When I called up my family and told them about the birth  the reactions were very mixed  My mom started to cry when I told her that I named my son after my brother and had to hang up because she was too emotional  She texted me later  however  saying that she was glad I used his name  but that my sister was writing me a very negative message that my mom absolutely disagreed with    Well  the message from my sister was  incredibly  hurtful  She told me how I was wrong for using our brother s name for my son without asking her  because she  as a full sibling closer to him in age  should have the right to use the name before me  and that I had upset my mom by using his name so shortly after his death  She said that she would not be able to come visit us after all  a visit was previously planned  because the whole situation made her feel sick and she was busy with school    I am very hurt by this message  We  never  used the term  half  before  brother  or  sister  in our family  It was even a running joke growing up   she isn t my half sister  look  she s got two arms and two legs    I can t believe that she views me that way now as I thought we had a good relationship    I understand that maybe it was insensitive that I didn t ask anyone before using his name  How do you guys feel about these honor naming conventions  Should anyone in the family be free to use a relative s name or should one ask for opinions beforehand     For the record  I d have no problem with it if my sister used our brother s name for her future child as well  but this is not something that s common for us  Cousins sharing a name is considered weird and not done in our large family  So I understand that maybe in her opinion  I  stole  the name    Now I just don t know how to fix the situation  She is the only sibling I have left and I d do anything to make this better  even if I don t personally agree     TL DR  I named my son after my late brother and my sister is upset  She thinks I should ve discussed it before and asked for permission  and that I stole the name from her for future use  How do I navigate this issue

829,0,Lost my best friend of over a decade because of two slices of pizzaSo I ve known this guy since we were about   years old and when he moved away at the age of   we still kept in contact  We would always have our moms drive us the long distance  over   hours  so we could still see each other and continue to be best friends   So we both graduated high school in      and that year I decided to move to the city he was in to attend college  So obviously we started to hang out just about every other day  He would pick me up and we would just hang out at his apartment he was renting from his mom  So fast forward to      and we are hanging out every second day just playing playstation and smoking some weed and what not  So in November we were hanging out at his place for the night and we were both super baked  We ordered a pizza for delivery and we just sat down watching Netflix while eating this massive pizza  Apparently he told me to leave the last   slices in the box for when he got home from work tomorrow  So like that s cool and all right   Only thing i was so baked that I forgot he even said that to me  So when I got off school the next day I went to his apartment to wait for him to get home from work so we could chill for abit and I remember that we didnt eat all the pizza  So I went and ate     slices and when he got home the first thing he said was  thank God I ve got that pizza left  and my stomach dropped  I remembered  then I started to apologize and I gave him    dollars for the    dollar pizza  He was clearly mad and he was just mumbling things under his breath so I packed my things and started to leave  I said I was sorry  paid for more than half the pizza  couldnt stay long because of a family event  and I didnt wanna deal with him being mad at me so when I went to my car he came out and started lashing out at me  I drove away and when I got home we hashed it out over text for a while and then he told me he needs time away for a while  So that s cool like I respect that  After a month  I decide to text him and say sorry again and I even decided to buy him his favorite pack of smokes  yogurt covered pretzels and a peace tea and I left it all on his door step  just to say I was really sorry and I missed being friends  He said thanks for the stuff and I thought maybe it was turning around  I texted him the next day and asked if we were okay and he said he still needed time  It s March now and he still wont talk to me but the funny thing is  he told me brothers he would still play playstation with me    Not really sure what to do anymore  I texted him and asked him what s happening because I tried everything and I m sorry and all he said was  not much was tried   Do I just give up on him  We were  literally childhood best friends  Is he willing to just throw it away    TLDR  got stoned and ordered a pizza with my best friend and he told me to leave the last slices there  Next day I ate     and now he wont talk to me  I paid for more than half the pizza and I ve tried calling and texting on multiple occasions 
830,0,He knows I m hurt  but yet acts like he s the one that s hurtIt s so frustrating to be the one that got hurt and watch him walk around like he s hurt  I m trying to keep my mouth shut because I always say something  At the end of the night he crawls into bed and cuddles me  but if I don t cuddle back he turns away  I want to so bad  but I m tired of giving in  I want him to say something especially when he knows he hurt me  Not saying physically  I m saying emotionally  I hate the silence and how he walks around like he is the one that got hurt  It kills me at night  It happens so frequently too that it s like hello you should know by now  But of course not  It s hard to sleep at night and my emotions are so bad it s taken a toll on my life  I feel weak  I barely eat and I can hardly go to work  
831,0,I am not physically attracted to my girlfriend of   years anymoreReason  When we first started dating I was very attracted to her and enjoyed our relationship very much  As of the past few years she has steadily gained weight to the point she is now a substantial bit overweight  This has created a very poor mental state for her of poor self image as she doesn t see herself as attractive  Our physical relationship has suffered greatly due to this to the point where there s is almost no intimacy  We are both young me    her    and are in the prime of our lives  This lack of intimacy has caused me to completely lose my physical attraction to her as I now find her body not attractive as well as she is not comfortable enough with her own self image to ever feel sexy or intimate  I find myself constantly fantasizing about other women and checking out other girls on the street who I am extremely physically attracted to  Our emotional relationship is supportive and very amicable still and I would actually say it is quite good   but again the lack of any intimacy or physical relationship is crippling for me  Not sure how to handle this situation  She has tried a lot of different ways to lose the weight but just does not seem to be making any progress over a long period of time and now she refuses to do much exercise or anything to try
832,0,I  f     think my boyfriend  m    isn t attracted to me So I m a heavy girl  the biggest girl he s been with  He s expressed to me that bbw isn t his preferred body type  However he sometimes tells me that he is attracted to me and that he s fine with the body I have and he hates that I think everything is based on looks  We ve always had a problem with sex in our relationship  I always have to ask for it and initiate it and a lot of the time I get denied and there s usually a little bit of an argument or questions like  why do you need it every day    I asked if he wanted nudes and his response was  not now  and I asked if break was a better time to send them he said  probably   I m starting to think it s me  I found out he s requested to be in  post your best selfie  groups on Facebook  And caught him with pictures of porn stars on his phone  I m really confused because he says on thing but his actions say other things  Im trying to lose weight so maybe he d be more attracted to me so far I ve gone down   lbs but still nothing

834,0,How do I    F  tell one of my closest friends    M  that I ve been dating his ex    F  For starters  I m a girl and my friend is a dude  His ex my current partner is also a girl  They dated over     years ago in high school and in the time since she leans more towards being into women    My friend and I play in a band together  and at one of our shows   F was there  We were trying to get all our high school friends out as a  reuinion  thing and he texted her an invite  hoping he would hook up with her  He s a sensitive guy and it seemed he still had unreciprocated feelings for her   Well things took a turn for the unexpected when she texted me the next day asking to hang out and made her intentions pretty clear when she said I was  welcome to stay overnight later too    I had recently gotten out of a bad relationship and felt ready to move on from that  so  long story short  we ve been seeing each other over a month now and are actually dating now    The problem is that I haven t mentioned  any  of this to my friend  Like  I m not even sure he knows we re talking  I didn t want to tell him at first since I didn t know whether this was a hook up or going to lead to something more  and now that it s a legitimate relationship I think he should know    But how do I drop the  hey I m dating  girl  and actually have been for the past month   bomb without feeling like an asshole

836,0,My MIL wants to gps track me and I feel kinda weird about itI m    and my husband is     We got married about    months ago and his family has been super kind and inviting to me  even though we re still navigating the relationship switch from being their son s girlfriend to being his wife  My MIL is honestly fantastic  She s very sweet and loving and constantly checking in with me and buying me nice things  My own mother died when I was    so I m loving this new relationship and I really value her  The issue is  she wants me to turn on the gps tracking on my iPhone  which she bought me  to be fair   I m not sure why  but she requests my location a few times a week  I haven t turned it on  and I honestly feel weird sharing my exact location with her all the time  My husband and I share location with each other because it s convenient to know how far away the other is when driving home from somewhere  etc  but tbh I can t think of anyone else with whom I d be comfortable sharing that  She and I are both very non confrontational  and I don t want to hurt her feelings  which are pretty fragile  so I have no idea how to tell her she should stop requesting my location because I m not going to give it to her  but not damage the relationship I m trying to build with her  Help                                                                                            EDIT  I just want to clear a couple things up because I didn t communicate well in the first place  I mentioned the phone because I feel like it matters  she hasn t in any way implied that I m indebted to her over it or that she in any way controls my use of it  I just feel guilty that I keep declining her requests to track a phone she bought for me  She really is a sweetheart  I don t think she s trying to be manipulative or controlling  she s just weird lol  I was mostly hoping for advice on how to bring this up to her in a gentle way that won t hurt her feelings  I really appreciate all the comments so far though  You guys are making me think of new way to see the situation

838,0,I m    F  not happy with my relationship so far    M I feel like I m just using this guy as a rebound after my recent  breakup  or whatever you want to call it  The other guy i wasn t dating  but we were building up a relationship  Now since that is over  this guy came into my life last week and he s shown interest in me from the start  and starting saying he loved me and a bunch of stuff  I reciprocated it  because I felt bad just saying no  But I did feel something in the beginning  but I just feel like I m using him because I don t have the other guy anymore  He kind of weirds me out sometimes saying he s going to marry me in a few years  saying how many kids we ll have  saying he wants to be my first    I just    we just met  This is weird  Im not very comfortable or happy with this    He has autism and depression  so I feel like if I just tell him how I feel he ll do something bad to himself  I didn t want to get into such a big mess  I m not ready for this type of relationship after the last one  I think I just enjoyed the attention and affection given to me  But now I don t like this  I feel selfish and rude  but    I don t know  And we re living in different countries too so it s hard    edit  also he never asked me out or anything but acts like we re in a relationship  this is purely online  we met while playing a video game  i don t like this 
839,0,I    F  am in love with my fake husband    M  I ve been meaning to write this for a while now  Using a throaway because my friends know my account  Please excuse my mistakes  as english isn t my first language   TL DR at the bottom    amp  x   B   I met the most amazing guy about a two years ago   We met in college  by chance  after switching groups in a class  At first we weren t really close but as time went by we grew closer  we are just as weird  same dark sense of humour  same interests etc  etc  About a year into our friendship word got around that he and I were dating  not true   and we heard trough mutual friends who were delighted for us as  according to them  we look good together    We didn t mind the rumors so instead of denying them  and making everyone believe the rumours were actually true  we rolled with it and just for laughs we pretended to be a couple  It was supposed to be a one time thing  But in the end we kinda liked it and we kept on doing it for a couple of days  But  to take things further  we also began to pretend we were married  It was fun to see people s reactions and to tell crazy stories about our  marriage    People were curious and since we were so close and  meant for each other   no one doubted our story  That s when we decided to keep this marriage thing going  not just for everyone else to see but because we actually enjoyed our new  relationship   We agreed that we weren t actually dating and that it was more of a symbolic thing of the bond between us  Both he and I had dates with other people during this time and it was never a problem   I have to admit that even hough I hadn t felt any sort of attraction for him before  I really liked this  being a couple  thing  It was nice to feel all the support and affection of a relationship without being actually in it   I ve never had a boyfriend  nor he  and we ve never had a serious relationship with anyone else   This is when things began to confuse me   After a couple of months of pretending and having fun  he asked me about what kinds of things I found essential in a relationship  I said  emotional connection  friendship   intimacy  as in trust  and sex  He told me that he could see himself in an emotional and intimal relationship with a woman  but in a sexual relationship exclusively with a man  That s how he told me he was gay  At the time I wasn t shocked or anything because we had just been playing all this time   This didn t really change anything between us  so  we decided to keep our fake marriage going   A few months go by and one day out of nowhere he told me that he was worried that I would be falling in love with him  because he couldn t reciprocate  I told him that it was ok  that we had discussed this before and that I didn t mind  However  he then told me that if he wasn t gay he would like for me to be his girlfriend   I agreed  saying that if he was straight I would date him  for real  as well  but that I still loved him as gay as he is and that it was okay  I wasn t heartbroken or anything   We agreed to stay as friends and fake husband and wife   At this point our fake relationship had minimal body contact  never kissing or anything beyond that  and it was mostly using cheesy nicknames for each other and having dates  these were actually pretty fun    Things were just fine   But time went on and on and we grew even closer  so much  that I feel we are in a different kind of relationship right now   Things changed after I stayed over a couple of times listening to music and having deep conversations  We began to have more  real  dates  and we began to behave like a couple  in public and away from our friends  more naturally  We touch a lot more  hugging  holding hands  playing with each other s hair   we have more meaningful conversations and the kind of intimacy that typical couples have  as in the kinds of things they share and the amount of time they spend together  but we ve never kissed or had sex   Now  when we said good bye we say  I love you   which we never did before   And our friends that knew we began our fake marriage as a joke now see our relationship as a cute  real thing between us  even though they all know he is gay   I think that he sees me differently now  I know for sure that I do  I love him so much now  Like true love  I have this fuzzy feelings for him  I fell for him  hard  and now I constantly think about him  I fantasize about us being together  etc   I m desperate  It makes me so sad to think that we may never be together   Here s my dilemma  should I speak to him about my feelings  I am afraid that he says he doesn t feel the same  or to make him feel bad because he can t love me completely  as regular couples do  I also don t want things to change  and I m afraid that if I speak to him he ll distance himself from me  although I doubt it    I think that he s kind of in love with me too  but I don t want to bring up the issue and just ignore the fact that he is gay and that we have had conversations about this in the past  But things felt so much different before   I would  however  agree to be in a non sexual relationship with him  I just love him so so much  I would basically agree to anything atm    amp  x   B   Reddit  what should I do    amp  x   B   TL DR  I pretended to be married to my gay best friend  just for fun   Things have changed and now I am actually in love with him     amp  x   B

844,0,Is she cheating  am I over reacting Hey guys  I ve got a bit of a situation that I m hoping to get an outside perspective on  My wife and I have been together for    years  no kids  For the past few years I ve been taking off to go sailing in Florida  where I keep my boat  for a two to three months every winter  Normally my wife would fly down for a week or two at a time  depending on her work schedule  to sail with me  When she s not with me I would sometimes pick up crew for short or complicated legs  or just to go on a day sail  This year a family friend  who is female and about my age  happened to be at the same marina as I  so I invited her to sail around an island that I wanted to see  So we left my slip  sailed our intended route  came back to the slip and said friend departed  the whole trip was around   hours  I called my wife to let her know that I was back  and that so amp so had gone with me  She s furious   She starts accusing me of cheating with  that woman   etc  etc  I try my best to assure her that nothing happened  that she was just part of the crew  that I would never cheat on her  but this doesn t seem to help  We agree to disagree  but her behavior seemed very odd  The next day I found out she had called friends of ours at the marina as well as members of my family trying to find out more about this woman  My friends told her that they saw us come into our slip  then saw the woman leave right after  I spoke with my wife later that day and she said everything was fine  and we proceeded to have a normal conversation  Fast forward one week and my wife starts sexting me  this has never happened before   I find it odd  but welcome it as our relationship had gotten a bit stale    By now it s time to put the boat away and fly back home  The day before I m to leave for home I drop my cell into the water  gone forever along with all of my data and contacts  I didn t know you could back all that up to the cloud   So I get home  buy a new phone  and prepare to manually re enter all the names and phone numbers  I ask my wife for the password for our Verizon account so I can download my call logs and put the contacts in my phone  She gives me the password  but at the same time tells me her phone got hacked so there are calls and texts from her phone to a local number that she never made    She over explained some elaborate story of how it s impossible for her to be making those calls and texts  how she was at work or sleeping  etc  I m not saying anything or making any accusations during this display  nor have I since any of this occurred  but the smell of bullshit is getting pretty strong    That night we make love  and she has a vigor that I haven t seen since we first started dating    years ago  This continues on for the next week  she s bringing home toys and oils  making love at least every day  Keep in mind our previous sex life was very vanilla and never more than once a week and never anything that Jesus wouldn t approve of    So  I finally get around to going through my call logs and re entering my contacts  I happen to glance at her records and  like she says  there texts  calls  the longest being     hours  from her phone to a certain number  The funny thing is they all started a day after the day she accused me of cheating with the other woman on the boat  and her subsequent newfound sexuality   Digging deeper into the phone records I see she was also calling this number a few months earlier    days after I left home to go to Florida   So  I m playing it cool  not making any accusations as I don t have any solid evidence of cheating  just a really silly lie about her phone getting hacked  She made a point one night to scroll through her text messages in front of me  and of course the calls and messages to the certain number are all missing  Ive googled the number to try to find out who the owner is  but I didn t get any solid info or recognize the names associated with the number  Ive been trying to get my hands on her phone to do some peeking  but she s takes it everywhere with her now  even into the shower    I ve thought about calling the number or texting to ask how they know my wife  but I would suspect that the man on the other end knows she is married  so I would be playing my cards and still not have any more info    Does anyone have any advice  or been in this situation before   Am I just over reacting and reading into this too much   I need more proof before I confront my wife about this  but at the same time I don t want to let whatever happened slip through the cracks    Thanks

846,0,The guy I like doesn t believe he deserves love until he has finished losing weight  Is there anything I can do to change his mind I m   F  he s   M  I have known him for quite some time  and have had a crush on him for a while  He has always been visibly overweight  but I still really liked him and found him attractive  Recently he has been working hard to lose the weight  and he is doing a great job  So far he has lost about   kg  It s a noticeable loss  and I find myself more and more attracted as he continues to improve himself   Recently I was feeling confident  and I asked him out to coffee  It wasn t an obvious date  I just tried to keep things casual  We had a really great time  and we even had a second  date   I ended up admitting to him that I liked him  and asked if he wanted to make things a bit more serious between us   Hearing this made him really sad  He said he really liked to me and would really like to take a chance with me  but he just couldn t  He told me that he still believes because of his weight he doesn t deserve love yet  He still has another      kgs to lose before he feels like he would be ready  He also said that it s his biggest motivation  and that he worries that getting a girlfriend halfway through could make him feel complacent  I told him that I already found him attractive  and that he does deserve love because he already has worked so hard for it  Things got really emotional and we both ended up crying   Is there anything I could possibly do to make him come around to the idea of a relationship  He said after he lost all the weight  if I was still interested he would love to pursue things  but he doesn t expect me to wait for him  But I really like him  and I don t want to wait  and I really want him to understand that he  and everyone else  deserves to be loved

can t remember what the argument was but it lead to her taking my laptop so I wouldn t be able to submit an assignment  saying  you can fail  I don t care it doesn t benefit me anyway   I grabbed back at my laptop  she took this as an attack yelling that I pushed her and grabbed my hair  I lost it and tried to fight back  My dad had to hold me back  and then slapped me across the face a couple of times to get me out of this rage   Yeah  not my brightest moment  I sunk into a depressive episode  Because I m a pussy  and wanted a relatively painless death I planned to drink poppy seed brew thing  and take some sleeping pills  I would ve preferred a gun shot  but owning firearms is illegal in my country  I didn t in the end  because I know it would hurt my family and the guilt won me over   Anyhow  I wanted to move out   and this incident came up as one of the reasons why  She doesn t think she did anything wrong  and says  you know how I am  I just see red whenever I see how my children try to attack me   Mention of how she previously dealt with me in my highschool years also came up  I was depressed and completely unresponsive and as a result wouldn t even get up to go to school  Her response was to try to beat me up  drag me out by the hair and try to strip me naked  I think she was trying to change my clothes  But it was humiliating  and she was still pulling my hair whilst doing it  She said she didn t care as long as I had my  depressive episodes  at school  and not at home so she wouldn t be harassed by the council  Besides that  she was supportive when it came to how the school dealt with me  It took me having a mental breakdown at school to finally get help  and a diagnosis  After going back and forth  all this resentment finally clicked in my head  and I blurted out  you have no idea  how close I was to killing myself   She went really quiet  and started getting ready to leave for work saying something along the lines of  I m going to leave before you break me apart  I m sorry I wasn t the kind of mother you wanted  but my intentions always came out of my love for you    Also  I feel I should mention  that it wasn t the best time for such a conversation  it just kinda happened  because my grandad  her dad  is currently hospitalized and she s been told he hasn t got much time left  So emotions were probably already running high  despite her stiff upper lip   She is extremely against me moving out  She says she doesn t want to limit my freedom after I said    me potentially moving out is not a request  it s a statement   Reasons she stated      The incident was an exception  we ve had a few  exceptions  but I accept that these occurrences aren t consistent     My relationship with my mum has been extremely good since then  almost like how it used to be  and always is as long as we maintain the unspoken to rule to just ignore these  exceptions  and pretend it never happened     She wants to buy me a flat after I graduate  since she s been raking up good money recently from her job    Moving out would fuck with my debt  edit  as a student   Considering I ll be roughly         in debt which would be easier to deal with than the potential         if I were to move out    I live       minutes away from uni by train  so what s the point    I am going to be in my final year  and I will be more stressed out if I live alone  though I plan to flatshare with a friend  but you get the point     She doesn t mention this outright but it is implied that I don t know how to do anything by myself  But I feel that s something I ll learn if I move out   The advantages of staying feels overwhelming  and reaps long term benefits   that and I feel terribly bad about how much it upsets my mum to even mention moving out  I also feel guilty about leaving the family  because I won t be there to help out and take care of the kids and provide support  My dad suffers from bipolar  and my mum is the breadwinner   so I m usually the second in charge when it comes to the household  especially concerning my younger brothers   Perhaps I could stomach another year  since there s only one left  My main concern is that  the Christmas incident actually interfered with my grades   the fact that she tried to take my laptop with the intention to sabotage  And the whole incident sunk me into a relapse that fucked with my grades even more  I m completely lost  and confused  I m really scared of moving out  But I m scared of staying here too  Maybe distance will improve our relationship  I hear that those that moved out for uni had a better relationship with their parents   This really drags my mum  but it s not always bad  I have really good times with my mum too  and she s not a bad person  That s what brings me back to her  you know  She s had to sacrifice a lot for me as a parent  We just    don t understand each other  We don t know how to    TLDR  I have an extremely on and off relationship with my mum  is it worth me moving out now  Should I wait another year  And how can I improve my relationship with my mum   Advice would be greatly appreciated  Sorry for the extremely long post  but thank you if you did take the time to read this    amp  x   B 
848,0,I don t know if I m   M  single and how to handle thatI already made two post and then deleted them because I was too emotionally involved to write them appropriately      I have been in a relationship with a girl   F  for more than a year  We had  in a year  only one  serious  argument it wasn t serious enough for thinking of breaking up    We had a very good relation  sometimes I didn t show enough care  but generally we were really into each other   I m a bit shy  and she didn t always appreciated that  it took me months to tell her that I loved her even if I felt that since the first day   In the last month February  I didn t give her the right attention because I was training to do a semi pro kickboxing event   Two weeks after I competed she dumped me without giving any explanation but with  the promise of speaking again    Two weeks have passed  and she hasn t contacted me since then  A mutual friend told me she is confused  and she s still thinking  I accept it  and I respect it  but it s becoming really distressful  because to me it isn t clear if I should just call myself  single  or if I should wait to have  the speak  with her    I thought for the past two week and  after the initiale despair I managed to pull myself together and accept that she left me  But now that I have accepted that  thinking of the relation  I realized I really care about her  and now I m sure I would never allow anything to take over my relation with her  because it s really important      What should I do  Just close my eyes  trying to stop thinking about her  Wait for her  writing a long letter in which I explain that I understood how much she means to me and sent it when she decide to talk to me again  I m following the second approach  but I don t know if it s okay and if it really be useful    amp  x   B    On a side note  how many grammar mistakes did I make  I never write about these sort of things in English  and it s way harder than I thought about

850,0,My roommate  M    cheated on his girlfriendSo I am currently studying abroad in Europe and I have another American student as my roommate in our host family s home  we ll call him L   L seemed like a quiet and reserved guy when I first met him but as time passed and everyone in our program got more comfortable and started going out more  he changed into an outgoing person who loved to go to the club and dance  L also has never really drank alcohol or smoked before and didn t know what it felt like to be drunk or high  And finally being given the chance and freedom to try it all  he did  He drank and smoked a little but never really fully felt inebriated  which made him feel discouraged about it all  This led into a trip that most of the kids on the program went to a nearby island  On this trip  where I didn t go  L finally got completely wasted and totally shitfaced drunk  While he was wasted  a classmate of ours came up to him and kissed him which lead to them making out for about    seconds  Of course I didnt find out about this until he told me when he came back  but when he had told me this I had said to him  so you cheated on your girlfriend    and at first he didn t think it was cheating because he was too drunk to even function and knows that he wouldn t do it sober  After realizing that he did cheat  he felt guilty about it and decided to tell his girlfriend  Basically  his girlfriend ended things right then and there and blocked him on everything and said some pretty mean things to him  He tried to explain and tell her that it was his first time being so drunk and he couldn t control what he was doing and that the girl came on to him and he never had prior history with her  but obviously she wasn t having any of that and completely cut him   Now  L is devastated and when I got home the night she broke up with him I saw him breaking down and sobbing  It s been a couple days after she broke up with him and he s starting to not care for himself anymore  He doesn t eat and will starve himself  he thinks negative thoughts like joking about jumping off the bridge  he says he hates everyone  he won t listen to me when I try to make him feel better  I understand that he is going through the motions right now and needs to hurt before he can heal but I want to be there for him and try to make his experience abroad as good as it can be  even though he just got dumped    So I guess what I am asking is  how can I help L think more optimistically and try to make the best of his situation    amp  x   B   tldr  my roommate who is inexperienced with alcohol got wasted and made out with another girl  he told his gf and she broke up with him and now he is devastated

854,0,My fianc  mental health is straining our relationshipSome background first  My fianc     M  and I    f  have been together for almost two years and have been engaged for about six months  I want to clarify that I love my fianc  with all of my heart  This has just been an issue for a very long time and it might be affecting us negatively soon   My fianc  suffers from extreme anxiety and has some issues with his anger  He never treats me badly or puts a hand on me  I ve been in the kind of relationship before and won t ever do it again  Again  my fianc  treats me wonderfully  I myself also have mental health problems  depression and anxiety  We have both been very patient and compassionate towards each other and helped each other as much as we can   My fianc  health is definitely worse than mine  He needs medicine but does not have insurance and as we are not married yet  he cannot be on my plan yet  My fianc  had health insurance when we were first together  but it was lost  My fianc  has quit every job he has had in the past year  His first job I understand why  he was put in a very scary and unsafe situation and his employer did nothing to fix the situation  After this he has quit because of anger  Either his boss was  treating him like shit  or he missed too many days and quit so he wouldn t be fired  Now he misses work a lot  If he is sick in his mind it is a life or death situation and a cold will eventually result in him going to the emergency room  where nothing was wrong  I tried to stop him every time but his mind is made up   Currently we are living with his parents saving up for a car and an apartment  His car kicked the bucket last week and that has been pretty hard on us getting to work  This morning everything was fine until he made his lunch  His parents have a huge dog where her head is above the table and as my fianc  was making his lunch the dog licked his sand which  He was the most mad I have seen him in months was screaming and yelling  I asked him to stop since his parents were still sleeping  He wouldn t listen  He eventually got some mad he either clinched his jaw or closed his mouth really fast and chipped his tooth  This leads to a new panic  He throws away his sandwich  saying he will get sick if he eats it  Will not listen to me whatsoever then proceeds to tell me he can t go go work and needs to get emergency dental work done  Mind you he barely chipped his tooth  Isn t even noticeable really  I pleaded with him not to go and he said I didn t care about what happened when I do  I just can t feed his idea of going to the hospital when it s not needed  I get extremely frustrated  late for work and leave because I know he will do what he wants anyway  After I leave he tells me he s going to work because his mom and stepdad threatened to kick us out  They told him if he loses his job we re gone  I m just completely lost at this point I love him with all my heart and want to help him  We have no where to go if we get kicked out  Does anybody have any advice with dealing with a partner with mental illness or have been in similar situation  
855,0,LiesMy SO is constantly lying about small matters  Whenever I find out about his small lies  it ends up being a bigger problem compared to if he would have just told me the truth in the first place    He says its to avoid an argument or because he knows ill have a problem with it so he just withholds information    I ve always told him that no matter what it is  I will always prefer the truth even if it hurts me   So what s your advice or opinion on the matter   Are small lies okay  
856,0,I    M  am confused by my girlfriends    F  actions recentlyI am a senior in college and my girlfriend just graduated and is working a full time job  This past week I went on spring break to LA and Vegas and since I very much like my girlfriend I didn t do anything I d regret  While I was away  on Saturday  she went to brunch with her high school friends    girls and a few guy friends they have all had since high school and have all been platonic with since high school   She messaged me earlier in the day Saturday because she sometimes says shitty things to me when she is drunk  mostly gets upset and angry at things she doesn t need to  She said maybe she just won t message me until she gets home  and I said I didn t like that idea  She said she was joking and asked me what was wrong and I explained  She continued brunch and continued texting me  then she got a little too drunk  She called me and I called back and to make a long story short  I ended up having to arrange an Uber for somebody who was very blacked out and very disoriented which took about    phone calls and an hour and a half while I was a nervous wreck and thousands of miles away  She got home safely and went to sleep  She called me when she woke up and had no clue what I had done for her and what kind of situation she put herself in  and she really really wanted to see me because it had been like   days and she felt bad about her actions  When I saw her next  everything was great  I made sure she knew that although it wasn t pleasant  I d always put forth that type of effort for her and not hold it against her  We went on a nice date when I got back and then when we were laying in bed later had some great conversation  revealed a good amount about our pasts to each other  She spoke to me about her Ex which I know is something she wanted needed to do as it was a     year relationship  We both used phrases like  love of my life  and she even said something like  when we spend the rest of our lives together   Now we ve only been dating about   months but honestly  where I am right now  I could marry this girl    I am very confident she wants me and only me  but I can t help but think otherwise given this situation  For instance  she is going out with these same friends in a few weekends  and I can t help but worry that she will get drunk and do who knows what  I know for a fact that her friends and family like me  and I know for a fact that I treat her the best that I possibly can  She is a great and moral person  and cheating is one of the last things she d ever do  This is my first relationship and I don t know how to handle being worried about things like this    Here s where my mind is running amuck  While she was at brunch  she archived a picture of ours on Instagram  I mean whatever I m not that controlling  I just can t think of a reason she might archive our most recent picture at brunch and then un archive it as soon as she woke up the next day  That combined with her  joking  that maybe she wouldn t text me until she got home is what has me worried  That s sortof where I am looking for help  Not to come up with an excuse  just looking for a non biased opinion on why she might have acted this way    My theory is  She was a little bit nervous about me in Vegas with my friends    guy friends    girls  one was my best guy friends girlfriend  and the other was her roommate who was potentially being set up with my second guy friend  I made it very clear that this second girl was there and that she had absolutely nothing to worry about  My girlfriend did NOT make it clear that there were   guys at brunch  but that doesn t mean anything  I know some of the guys showed up as friends of friends and it s not fair to assume any foul play   and she got a little more drunk than expected  Why she archived the picture  I can t figure out    Sorry for how long this is  and thanks for your help  To the commentor that will inevitably tell me my girlfriend is lying and cheating  please refrain  
857,0,Ex contacting during no contactMy gf said she wanted a break after a fight we had last month  She still contacted me during that time and we were talking for a month before we met in person for   days  While meeting in person  she acted hot and cold and we did not get intimate  I kept my calm and asked her   times in   days if she wanted to make the relationship work  She just said  I am not sure but I know that I love you  which doesn t make a lot of sense  We dated for   years before breaking up  After our last meeting  I decided to go no contact as i was really hurt and the whole situation was taking a toll on my health  It s been   days of no contact and she sent me an email on the first day and also called me on the first day  Second day was silent  She pinged me on FB on  rd day and contacted a common friend on third day again stating the same that  she loves me and will always love me  and she called me twice again on  th day  Until now I have not responded as I am fed up with this  I love you and I care for you  thingy  Tbh  I want her back but I am not sure how will that happen  Should I stay with NC policy  I am afraid of the fact that if I pick the call  she would again repeat the same  I love you and I care for you  talks which I am tired of listening

868,0,I  M    had sex with my boyfriend  M    and my parents found out and are forcing me to cut contact entirely with him  What do I do  I love him and don t want to lose him I m lost and I have no idea what to do here    I ve been unable to stop thinking about him since it happened  I ve been in another breakup before  but it wasn t nearly as bad as this    the worst part is that neither of us wanted to break up  there were no compatibility issues as far as we could tell and the only thing in our way is my parents   For the record  it was a little fast  I d only known him for a few months and had been talking mostly online for that time  but was on telegram for several hours a day chatting with him and other friends  before meeting up      minute drive but I m in the midwest and used to those kinds of travel times  and going on like    official  dates   I just sort of fail to see where the problem is  The act was consensual and mutually enjoyable  The act was legal  in my state  due to close in age exceptions  The only issue is that we kind of didn t use any protection  but we were both clean and nothing came of it  so why would they feel the need to artificially destroy our relationship like this   I guess what I m asking is what  if anything  I can say to my parents  my therapist  my friends  anything to convince them to let me have him back  We live in a highly religious state and both of them were raised highly religious  no longer religious but still carry some values  so it ll be hard    I d consider lying to them and saying it was just some friend except I m a terrible liar and they always break down when I betray their trust     So  TLDR  Am gay  Had sex  broke up against both our will due to interfering parents  I ve never been gayer or more in love with anyone before     Was it the right thing for them to break us up  And    What can I do to get them to change their mind   Posting from a throwaway because they know my reddit tag and I don t want this to show up in my dad s feed  Also  if you re my dad  hey dad  Therapist said I should be careful not to let you have      say in my love life and sex life so yeah please uhh let the crowd decide if it was the right move or not thanks
869,0,How do I    f  tell my boyfriend    m  that it s unfair he gets to have a cell phone and I don t Incoming huge wall of text  I m sorry   I havent had my own phone in about a year  He kept such secure tabs on my old phone because of his own insecurities and it became a huge stress point in our relationship that I agreed to finally give the phone up and use his   Obviously I drifted away from friends and family because he wouldn t let me talk to anyone who tried to call text  or he wouldn t even tell me they tried to contact me    I ve never been huge on social media and I ve always deactivated everything for months at a time because it just wasn t my thing and it still isn t  honestly    Recently we had a huge problem  I ve always been insecure with him having his phone in the shower because of the many girls he had added and we had problems with him flirting in the past  I kept telling myself it s not a huge deal and to not be crazy  this is his relaxing time away from me  etc  One night I fell asleep right after he said he was going to shower and I put on a movie to watch but ended up falling asleep because I m almost five months pregnant and sleepy all the time  I woke up    minutes later  and the movie was at     minute mark so I knew he was in there for almost an hour  I got up to pee and he was standing in the shower with a boner and got upset at me when I undressed  opened the curtain and started to get in with him  He said I needed to trust him  stop being a creep and watching him shower  and how he should be able to shower alone  I felt really bad about it and ended up getting dressed and finishing my movie    About a week or so ago a couple of my friends randomly came over to visit because I didnt have my own phone and there was no way to contact me  They told me my neighbor down the hall had contacted them and basically said my boyfriend was trying to cheat for the past month and I should go over and talk to her while bf was gone  I went the next day and was shown proof that he was indeed being a trifling asshole and even saw a recorded onscreen video of her opening a snap from him on snapchat and seeing his boner  I immediately wanted to vomit  The tub had the little fishies on the bottom  the curtain matched the color of mine  and I obviously know what his dong looks like  I confronted him about it and he said it must have been an accident  but packed his things and left   A couple of days later I went to Verizon and got my very own phone  It feels really nice  I m talking to friends again and I was even able to talk to my brother  who is in prison  after not having a way for him to contact me for a very long time    I added an old guy friend of mine and basically cried and vented to both him and his girlfriend about what happened  Bf and I got back together and he asked if I talked to any guys and I said yes and showed him proof of the only guy I talked to and about what  He became pissed the hell off and accused me of trying to steal my good friend s boyfriend  even though I was talking to them both at the same time and she knows that I m also friends with her boyfriend  He said that s why I wasn t allowed a phone  I m not to be trusted  and I tell everyone our business which is worse than what he has done  I apologized for venting about him and agreed I shouldn t have told anyone what happened  but at the same time it needed to come out because I was so sick and stressed out about it  Nobody else knows what happened except the two girl friends who came to tell me   He gave me an ultimatum  I return my phone  cancel my contract  and he ll come back to me  I told him if I need to return my phone he does too  He said no  because what I did was worse than him  accidentally  sending a nude   I m more than willing to work this out  I suggested couples counseling for us and separate therapy  I told him I shouldn t have to give up my phone if he doesn t have to give his up  Is there any way I can convince them how one sided all of this is  Am I better off just completely fucking forgetting it   TL DR  Boyfriend won t let me have my own phone because I vented to a guy friend and his girlfriend about him being unfaithful  He gave me the ultimatum to give up my phone but doesn t feel like he should give his up  too  Is there any way I can convince him of how one sided this is 
870,0,Boyfriend    m  made a weird comment about cheating that is making me    f  wonderLast night I was telling him that I was worried he ll get bored with me  he reassured me that he won t  if he gets bored we ll try new things together   But then tonight he brought it up again and said  You need to be careful with the whole  I m worried you ll get bored of me thing  because  and bear with me this is a long way to go for this  but if you keep saying that  I m going to start thinking maybe you re getting bored  and if I think you re getting bored  I may start thinking you re thinking about cheating on me  and if I think you re thinking about cheating then I may think this is just going to be over and start to think about cheating on you   Then he asked   are you actually worried I m going to get bored of you    To which I responded  well I m certainly not going to tell you if I am NOW    WTF  What the actual fuck  
871,0,My      husband is incapable of holding any kind of conversation with me      unless it benefits him   I find this exhausting This is a throw away   just as a side note   This is a thing I have been dealing with for quite some time  and yes  I have discussed it time and time again    There was a time  in the beginning    years ago  when things were new when he would easily be able to hold an interesting conversation with me   perhaps I was tricked     Back story   My husband plays a ton of games on his phone  this is another side issue in our marriage   it is day and night  and he will neglect his duties in the home in order to play games  He will neglect work duties  social obligations or anything else in order to play games    We have a   year old son  and are currently living in Germany  We are quite secluded from other Americans  so we rely heavily on each other for social interaction  We know other English speakers  but sometimes it is nice to have conversation with those that are fluent  We have lived in   other countries before this   Spain  and SE Asia  and this has continually been an issue  Gaming and lack of conversation   Let me break down how a normal dinner out will go down   We will sit down and order drinks  and where normal people would strike up a conversation about their day  I will start a normal conversation and be met with silence  and a nod  Maybe a single word  no eye contact  perhaps a shrug    At this point I will usually continue to talk  or maybe talk to our son    Last night  I brought up some difficulties I was having in my masters program  some items were not working out how they should  and after the usual nod  silence and one word  He then began to discuss how his transfer wasn t going well  and began to talk about that   never really addressing what I needed to discuss    After that  more silence while I continued to talk  and then the phone came out  After that all was lost  Please note  that I do not take my phone out during family time   or very little during the day  I simply do not have time for it   I make very deliberate efforts to make conversation with him  and I am stonewalled each time    I have brought up the fact that he does not speak back  and one word answers  and nods aren t conversation or talking  and that I find it hurtful and unacceptable  nothing has changed  I find myself wanting to be out of the house  and away from him as much as possible so that I can gain the social interaction that I so badly need  because I am so desperately lonely   Has anyone ever been through anything like this  Or has anyone ever been the one who has done this to their spouse  I just want to try to understand it    I am a social person  and I thrive in an environment where I get to talk to someone   it makes me feel loved and wanted  and I am just not getting that  and haven t been for a very long time   Thanks in advance

874,0,My relationship could be dyingThis is my first post on reddit and I am hoping that you beautiful people can offer some guidance  Me  M    and my fianc e  F    have been together for   years and getting married this year  High school sweethearts and all that  We were extremely physical at the start of our relationship  Sex all the time and sneaking around to be intimate wherever and whenever we could  This goes on for about   years and then we moved in together  It was awesome for a while and the physical part of the relationship was still there  but fading  Now  almost two years later  it has almost completely stopped  The worst part is  is that it s my fault  She wants to have sex all the time and I find myself coming up with excuses before she even asks or makes a move  We might have sex once a month or every few weeks  All other parts of our relationship are still wonderful  We stimulate each other intellectually and emotionally  but the physical aspect is seriously lacking  She is gorgeous and guys always hit on her when we go out and I do find her extremely attractive  When we have sex it s great  but I turn her down a ton  She wants me to have my testosterone levels checked and that makes me nervous for a lot of reasons  Any advice would be welcomed and really appreciated  
875,0,Feeling lost and frustratedHi  everyone  My girlfriend   LL  and I    HL  have been together for     years  We ve been having sex issues for the last year and a half  It s been spotty  Maybe once a month if not once every other month  I hate that we have these issues  I ve done everything she s asked of me to try and make things better  Which includes  therapy  getting out more  not focusing so hard on sex  and trying to get out more as a couple  She has claimed that these things should help improve our sex life  but it s remained this way  To be fair  she s tried to help  but she got off birth control thinking it was affecting her hormones  Nothing improved   I ve approached the subject calmly   Explaining how I feel and why  I feel so unwanted  Am I wrong to say I feel unloved as well  If she loves me  my needs should matter  right  This is where shit starts to really get under my skin  She always says  I m just really tired  when I try to initiate things  I get it  She works a physically demanding job  However  if she s so tired how can she muster up the energy for yoga after work with her friends AND a few beers afterward  It s hard to not feel like me  my feelings  and my needs are being brushed under the rug   I do everything this girl asks of me  This isn t to say she isn t a good girlfriend  She s great  It s just thing one thing that s really fucking up everything else  Any advice would be great  Thanks   
876,0,Boyfriends incel friend is ruining our relationship Hi everyone  My boyfriend and I have been dating for   weeks  We reconnected online after going to Hs together and are both mid twenties  I do have three children from past relationships   he does not   In HS  my boyfriend and I were in two different social crowds  I was more popular and he was more of a geek nerd loner  Admittedly  I rejected him once when we were teens  but I suggested that we stay friends   We reconnected after bumping into each other around town  I actually asked him out  And he said yes   Everything is great except for his stupid incel friend that he should have left behind a long time ago  and is also still a virgin       This friend has been getting in my boyfriends ear lately about how  I don t really love him and I m just using him for  beta bucks  and how I am gonna cheat on him or probably already am   He also makes disparaging remarks about my children and makes fun of my BF and calls him names  I won t mention them however they are usual alt right and incel buzzwords    Now  my boyfriend has been having doubts lately and has been asking me questions like why did I reject him in HS  obvious answer   I was immature and spent all my time chasing the hot popular guys but now I realize that most treated me like shit and I want a partner who actually loves me   Or he is asking when can I give him children of his own  even though he knows I am done having children   And even wants to know how many people I have been intimate with   I feel like putting him on the spot and saying it s either his dumbass fucking loser incel  friend   who btw honestly is probably just jealous  or me    
877,0,My   M  wife   F  recently reconnected with her childhood crush and admitted to have feelings for him  Don t know what to do hereTLDR   My   M  wife   F  of   years of being married and   years of being together  recently reconnected to some classmate of hers from school and they have been talking for hours  I asked about it  she confessed that she had a crush on him since school and finally he has asked her out  Now she is feeling butterflies and I feel like looking for a way to this mess to resolve    amp  x   B   Background   My wife grew up in a strict religious environment in a small town  and her parents were very controlling and didn t let her date boys while she was in high school  and she did t immediately go to college and stayed there and worked some job  She finally got enough independent financially that she decided to move and get into college and she moved to my city to go to college  She shared apartments with many people but according to her  most were out to get into her pants  Finally she rented the room in my apartment and moved there  That is how I got to know her  I never made any pass at her  unless she told me herself that she liked me  I like her as well  and we are so compatible that everything was easy with her  So we dated for a little shy of one year  and then decided to get married  Her parents of course didn t like me first  but after talking to them and spending time  they gave me their blessings as well  We had a little rocky relationship at first as she is still studying while I work  and she is heavily dependent on me  of course she has some savings of her own   so I kinda got a financial hit after marriage  but that is something that we resolved after few months  We are generally happy together  and were thinking of starting a family  I love her to bits    amp  x   B   Now few days ago  she got some messages from an old class mate of hers and she got very visibly excited  I thought some old friend  She then went to the bedroom to talk to him for over an hour with door closed  In mean time  I made some tea  and went inside  where she shushed me to not say anything and just leave the tea on the table  I complied  Then the next day similar thing happened as she came from college  and then got a call  and went to bedroom and closed the door  Talking for way over an hour  I usually do not mind as she does talk a lot to her mother  my mother  her sisters  and some friends  But call it jealousy or suspicion I asked after a few days about who is that  She at first was like a class mate  very good friend     then after thinking for few minutes  she said that she will tell me the truth  He was a crush of hers in school  some handsome boy  and she was invisible to him  She somewhat stalked him as well to know all his favorite things and even where he lived  but never had the guts to do anything because of her strict religious family   So now he finally contacted her  and they have started talking  and she is feeling the excitement of young love all over again  I laughed at it  and was like its just childhood crush  no harm in talking  she probably just need closure  This was till I found that that she didn t tell that guy that she is married  and he asked her out  I got a little angry like  come on  how come you didn t tell him  She just said that she didn t wanna tell him  as she doesn t wanna lose him  as he will run away if he finds out that she is married  I am like this is ridiculous  he is gonna find out  and also what is this  Do you seriously have feelings for this guy  and She said Yes  but she can t be with him as she is already with me  It sounds good  but the way she said it feels like just because I came first  she feels like she is stuck with me  but genuinely wants to be with him  So to clarify that  we kinda had a soft fight  I decided to sleep separately  She came in middle of the night  and did some half assed apology where she said she is sorry but she has no control over her feelings  I do love her so I accepted  and jokingly said that she can always marry him if I die or we get divorce  to which she started giving me excuses like he won t marry a divorcee  her family won t talk to her  she had to move out     like she gave out all the possibilities that it won t work with him  The thing missing in her reasons was that it won t work with him because she still loves me and chooses me  But at the same time she feels guilty doing this to me  and kept saying sorry to me  and for me to forgive her  and then she cries on her own like she is feeling trapped with me     amp  x   B   So here am I  unable to sleep  writing this way early in the morning  I honestly think I will lose her  and even if she loves me  she loves him more  and I don t want to be the villain in someone else s love story  May be they are meant to be together  and I am the hurdle  I always thought that this the woman I will grow old with  and now all this has broken my dreams  I have no idea how to take it further  I still love her a lot 
878,0,Stress from my  M    law school and working full time is taking a toll on me and my  w    fianc  s relationship The beginning of our relationship was great  honeymoon phase where even her farts were cute  introduction of Indian food changed that dramatically   We never argued about anything serious and really had nothing serious to argue about as we were both younger and life hadn t really started yet  She had more life experience being a couple years older but for the most part we were in the same place  about to graduate and looking forward to starting our lives  I took   months after I graduated to start law school and I m the meantime found a full time day job where things were great again  we lived with my parents at this point to wait for her to graduate and find a job for us to get our own apartment  Again nothing to argue about besides my family can be annoying  Once I started law school life started piling on  I would be gone from      to    pm three days a week and hardly see her during the week  Weekends weren t much better since I d be shut in the office reading for class  But I always tried to find a balance to get some kind of seeing her and the stress of balancing this heightened when we moved into our own place  That first quarter in our new place I made the decision to take an extra class to graduate quicker  this probably took    years off my life and my chest still hurts  It s been a rough time and I m finding myself more sensitive  defensive  and I m jumping on her when we argue now which mostly come from having a lot more miscommunications and getting paranoid when she has a tone I m misreading it and heated arguments follow  I don t know how to find balance in my life again and my mental state because I m feeling it writing this post  I m considering therapy or counseling to manage my stress along with my combativeness in my arguing  but I m not sure if it will help and be a waste of time  Insight on the benefits of therapy would really help  and if anyone else can speak to their experiences of stress affecting relationships it could help me a lot  I m getting married in June and I can t wait to make her my life partner  I just want to do everything I can to make her happy like we used to be  
879,0,I think about my ex constantlyIt s been   months since I stopped seeing this guy  We always had a great time when we were together but when we were apart is when we had big problems  He was reclusive and would often cancel on me last minute  We would go days without talking  I was the one who ended things because it was taking too much of an emotional toll    This was my first relationship after facing a sexual assault  I felt very close to him and I believe he felt the same way  he hadn t had a relationship in   years   I don t regret ending things because I knew it was for the best  I cried over him so many times and spent days on end feeling worthless    What I don t understand is why  after all of this  do I think about him daily  I have dreams where we run into each other  we are still friends on social media and I check his pages almost weekly  he rarely updates   I catch myself multiple times throughout the day daydreaming of being with him  or remembering times when we were together  It hurts so much  I don t know where to go from here  or if this will ever end    Will I ever move on  Five months feels like long enough that I shouldn t still be doing this  It s painful and wears me down mentally  
880,0,My      girlfriend      responded  yeah maybe  to a guy who asked her outMy      girlfriend      was asked out by some dude after a presentation at our uni  she responded  yeah maybe  because it was  awkward   I wasn t there to witness this but I don t think she would lie about what was actually said  so I m fairly certain that s exactly how it went down  her and her friend then walked away  Our relationship is great and we ve been together for   years  Should I be mad  I didn t initially react when she told me  and she seems to think it was funny  and that I would think it was too  I don t want to seem like an overprotective asshole  and as someone who s always struggled with self confidence  I m worried that I ll make her feel bad for something that I should just be able to laugh off  With that said  I feel like it shouldn t be very hard to say  I have a boyfriend   regardless of how awkward it is  Also  she s been asked out before and has always shut them down  I don t know why it was so  awkward  and difficult for her this time  I m reluctant to say anything rn because I m worried that she ll think I m immature

884,0,Am I screwed   Please send helpBack story   So there s this girl  let s call her Abby  I ve liked ever since she joined my school  about   months ago   We barely had any connection apart from the fact she was in my science classes and that my friend  which will be known as Nick  met her quite a lot outside of school  She was also going out with a Chad at the time so I had no chance of getting any shot with her   The story     months later  she has broken up with Chad and we are good friends  Because of Nick  we are much closer but not enough to be that shoulder for her to cry on  We started meeting each other and a few friends out side of school  She would occasionally give me the random hug but I feel it s just a  friend  hug  But those hugs mean more to me than it does to her so no massive improvement    month later   we are very good friends and we hang around most the time at school  outside of school and whatever  I was falling for her even more as I find out how much she actually means to me  But  this is where my dilemma is  I was really bored  so me and my friends got together and sat around just talking and shit  Out of no where  whilst everyone s in the kitchen drinking and shit  she turns to me on the sofa and says  your the only one I like here   I though this was my chance and we get to hugging on the sofa  I had never felt better in my life  My friends  being drunk out of their mind  don t really give a shit what s happening between me and Abby  but they want to go out onto this old abandoned park outside of my friends house  We go there and we play truth or dare  very mature I know   It gets to Abby and she picks dare  I think we know what s coming next  My friend dares her to kiss me which I was ok with but she didn t seem it  I ask her if she wants to and she says  no I like it where we are at    I felt awful  so I walked home without saying another word  I felt childish  and the worst that could happened  actually happened  so I thought I had the right to walk away  About    minutes on the way home I realise I might of lost the chance with the love of my life and I message her saying that I was sorry for walking away  She aired me  She ignored my calls as well  Apparently  according to my drunken friends  that she wanted to kiss me but was a bit nervous  Now I m sat here writing this  Sorry if it was a bit hard reading my shitty grammar and that lot  but I have nobody trustable to say this too  Am I screwed  I feel awful but I need some sort of answer so I don t go crazy  Thanks reddit

888,0,Friend asked me to  hang out this weekend   How do I respond to this A girl in my class that I talk to a few times  just messaged me this  How do I handle this  Is this a clear date invitation  I think thats what  wanna hang out  means at least  As I said  dont talk that often  we are friends  but there hasn t been any flirting  Honestly I am not romantically interested in her and its so surprising since we dont talk often  and we have never really hung outside of school before  Help
889,0,I    f  have a severe dependency on my best friend    f  and it may be ruining our friendship I have always had issues with being alone and currently struggle with depression and anxiety among other things  My best friend of   years also goes through many of the same issues that I have and we tell each other  mostly  everything  We always end up hanging out at least     times a week for several hours but it s always because I am the one to see if she wants to hang out  I do have other friends whom I rarely hang out with due to the fact they have busier lives than I do so I never have the chance  I struggle immensely with speaking to new people and making new friends is almost impossible for me  My best friend is shy as well but is way more open to making friends and is constantly doing so in many of her college classes  I think it s great that she s able to make friends with at least one person in each of her classes and if anything I m jealous that she is able to do that    My issue is that it s now really difficult for me to do anything without her  For example  going to the grocery store by myself  though it always had been an issue for me  is literally impossible without it resulting in a panic attack  And when I get stressed or nervous  which is several times a day  I always feel the need to text her to make sure I did the right thing or that what happened wasn t as awful as I believe it is  I ve noticed that I am always the one to see if she wants to hang out or anything like that and she never asks anymore  Granted the majority of the time she agrees to hang out unless she has plans with someone else  I honestly feel like such a burden in her life and I want to gain some sort of independence because I m an adult and it is ridiculous and so embarrassing  I ve tried distancing myself from her to gain some sort of sense that I don t exactly need her all the time but it just resulted in a depressive episode and just wasn t a good time    I have no idea how I could become more independent and not need to have her as such a crutch in my life  I have vaguely spoken to her about this and she says she has no issue with how dependent I am on her but nevertheless I feel pathetic about it  What are some ways I could try to separate myself from her so I m less dependent on her as a friend 
890,0,I feel betrayed after finding out my boyfriend is  best friends  with his ex on snapchatSo I ll try to make this short but  I feel background is kind of necessary    The short version is this  Ive been with my boyfriend for   amp     years and we ve lived together a little over a year now  We have an amazing relationship and we are very open with each other  He taught me a lot about communication and we ve honestly grown so much together  I have zero doubts that he is faithful to me but  after accidentally seeing his ex  who I didn t even know he was talking to at all  is his  best friend  on Snapchat  I can t help feeling betrayed     More details    His relationship with his ex was all online  He was with her for two years and she s the most recent one before me  She ghosted him several times for a month or two at a time during their relationship  The last time she ghosted him was October       he and I met   online  July      and became romantic November       I didn t know until later in our relationship that he had basically no healing time between us     So  fast forward like   or   months into our relationship and he finds out she ghosted him because she was cheating on him and was actually getting married  And even though im confident he loves me  I understand that hurt him and I supported him through that and let him know he s allowed to be hurt and I know it doesn t change his love for me    Then  we fast forward to maybe   months ago            She ends up calling him and they talk for like    minutes and she basically explains herself and apologizes  He tells me this immediately and I m happy that he finally got some type of closure    So then we have last night  I didn t have my phone so I grabbed his to take a Snapchat of how cute our dog was on his lap  And I go to send it to myself and at the top of the page is her name marked as his  best friend   Which means  that he is snap chatting her CONSISTENTLY  Because I snap him quite often and I wasnt marked as a best friend    I didn t recognize her last name so I asked who s  ex s name    Because  not in a million years would I assume it was her    He didn t answer so I asked again this time very serious to which he quietly says it s  nickname we have for her between us     To which I made a confused upset look and he replies with  what  you talk to your ex    So  to his credit  he may not realize that I tell him every single time I  talk  to my ex because I always comment on how bad I feel not responding to his snaps  because  like I ve told him  conversation with my ex always goes  hey  hey  how are you  good you  Good     I also always comment like  oh this pooor guy can t hold a conversation    because I would feel dirty and wrong if I talked to my ex without my boyfriend knowing    So  to clarify  I don t think my boyfriend is cheating on me and I know he would never intentionally hurt me  However  I realize that he has history with her and that feelings are a super complicated thing  So  I m only slightly worried that maybe he will start having feelings for her again  I don t see that being the case  I m more so looking for help with how to approach this and how to cope with my feelings  I feel betrayed  she s someone we ve basically hated together for a long time and now he s  best friends  with her  And Im also upset because it is definitely something he s been hiding from me  if not hiding then definitely neglecting to tell me  I m not a monster  I was happy she called and gave him closure and I would not have minded if he told me they were able to be friends again  I would have been happy for him  but now I don t even know how long this has been going on    Am I overreacting    P s  I didn t make a throwaway  he may find this post and that s fine  We both know we have to address it sooner or later  I m just trying to get some perspective on the situation before making him feel bad about something that probably isn t even intentional in the first place   
891,0,My    F  newly befriended neighbour  F  was nice and we clicked right away  but she s gone cold after one lunch and I have no idea whyWe live in an apartment complex with   other neighbours  all owner occupied   We re all cordial to each other  we respect each other s property and space and we don t really meddle with each other s lives  I still don t know what some of their names are and it doesn t really bother me   We all moved only months apart from each other and have been neighbors for more than a year  Walking my dog one afternoon  one of my neighbours  let s call her Marie  approached my dog and I  She said we should hang out and have coffee at her place   I hadn t spoken to her til that time  apart from hellos and smiles  and i thought it d be nice  We had coffee a couple of days later and we talked for   hours  I noticed she kept going on and on just about herself after getting to know only the basics about me  what I do for work mainly   But I m an introvert and she seemed like an extrovert  so maybe I wasn t assertive enough  Anyway  we arranged to have lunch with our partners the following weekend   Well  the lunch happened and lots of talking and laughs  Apart from the four of us  we were joined by two of her siblings too  I thought they were really fun and we had a nice time   Immediately after that I noticed Marie sorta changed  She became cold and closed off  The friendly neighbourly texts stopped    About a week after our lunch  my parents dropped us off and parked for a minute in front of their driveway  a no no  to say hi to our dog  Marie s partner  who was super nice  managed to park in their garage even though we said we d move the car  I overheard Marie bitching about us and angrily storming off  I texted her to apologise and said it won t happen again   Then  nothing  No more texts and I have a feeling she s avoiding us too  I keep thinking about lunch and if I said something wrong  but I can t remember anything  What just happened there 
892,0,How to I tell a very sensitive person thqt they habe a oretty gross habbit My dad is super sensitive to anything that could be interpreted as criticism  He s never been good at it  he s gotten better but it s still to the point where any type of harmless making fun out of him gets him upset or hurt    I live my dad  and he is super sweet in every sense  but he s not very aware of his own actions  perhaps a result of living alone for a long time  He has never been very hygienic  he doesn t wash his hands after the bathroom etc   However  he has this habit of whenever just standing or even sitting or whatever  he f cking scratches his ass  or just has his hands down his pants  He does it in front of everyone  and he doesn t wash his hands or anything  he even goes directly to cooking or touching your face after cupping his cheeks all day    How do I tell this sensitive person that what he does is very gross without him being butt hurt  pun intended

894,0,Ex attempted suicideThrowaway for obvious reasons    My bf was called in because he s the emergency contact on his ex s medical file and they tried to commit suicide   Family wasn t able to be contacted or just didn t care  Don t know   He s been there with his ex all day and the ex was moved out of ICU  refusing to be admitted despite needing help  and he s going to help with organising a mental health care plan in the next few days    I strongly feel that he did the right thing by being there initially  but as more time goes on the less comfortable I am with it   This is his most recent ex and I m the most recent partner   Not sure what I m asking here  but how would you support your partner in this situation   I d love to say that he should walk away now  that this part of his life is over and he shouldn t keep going back to help the ex in these crisis situations  but I can t bring myself to do it  I m worried that the ex may feel they ve still got control  especially if he goes running almost every time this happens  It s not that I want to control him  I just see how much of a toll this is taking on him and don t want him suffering because of others when he has his own things to deal with    For context his ex was a serious relationship  several years   we re still quite fresh only a few months in

896,0,He says he needs therapySo we have been arguing consistently about how much he has hurt me and why he can t seem to understand  He always says I m sorry and I understand and that he s listening  but then the next argument that s all taken back  but not literally  I am with a narcissist  He doesn t see how he makes himself the victim  He turns everything I say about him hurting me back around on me  I just wish I was good enough  It kind of hurt that he said he needs therapy  I mean that s good I guess  but why couldn t I be good enough in the first place if he s so in love with me  
897,0,i feel really alone in my decision making and i m not sure what to dohi  i am currently a college student at a school i am absolutely not a fan of  i just transferred here this semester and the school is huge  there is no community  and it s incredibly hard to make friends  i just hate it  however i decided to stick it out this semester and apply to a smaller school about a half hour away from where i am currently at    I really want to go to this school but my parents really don t want me to transfer  they think i am following my boyfriend  who goes to that school  but honestly that school just has more of a community and it s a school revolves around my major  engineering   i transferred from a smaller school and i just think that this new school i applied to would be a better fit for me    in that sense i don t want to rely on my boyfriend making this decision because i don t want my parents thinking that s why i did it  but when ever i bring it up to my parents or my sister they just think i m being crazy and tell me i m making a mistake that get upset that i am changing my mind about schools    today i got accepted into the school  it s so exciting but i have no one to really share it with because my parents will be upset i even applied   how do i talk to them  should i just plan things out and then talk to them once everything it set in stone so they re not stressed out about having to help with anything or should i let them know before hand  i m not really sure what to do here    tldr  i got accepted into my dream school  already transferred to a different school  thinning about transferring again  not sure how to talk to my parents who aren t fond of me transferring again

900,0,Boyfriend AdviceHello  I  F     have been dating my boyfriend  M     for a year in April  The other day we were talking and he was telling me how the other day he was having trouble with a friend  Jeremy  and needed advice so he called up his other friend  Anna  about it  Since we first started dating he has always called Anna his best friend and I genuinely like her  there isn t jealousy of her because Anna is in a relationship with a woman and is so welcoming and sweet to me     When we were talking and he said he asked Anna for advice  I realized he rarely comes to me for advice  Most of the time  he will tell me his issues afterwards and bring up how he asked other people for their opinions  Also  when I have given him advice  he usually never takes it and will do something else  whether that be his own decision or something someone else told him   This also reminded me how around a month ago there was a small issue because his ex girlfriend posted some really intense stuff about him on her instagram  literally saying she was still in love with him and how she believes he still loves her too   This post caused me to feel really weird and angered him because he hasn t even spoken to her in over a year and they ended over   years ago  they only dated for   months   During this  we were thinking of what to do  should he reach out to her and tell her to stop  Should we just ignore it  We noticed one of his closest friends  liked  the post which made me feel insecure because I don t know honestly it just made me uncomfortable especially since I am not very close to him  I bring this up because I wanted my boyfriend to reach out to his ex and tell her to please stop  but his friend Anna suggested he just leave it alone and ignore it  In hindsight  I think this was probably best  Also  I told him how weird I felt around his other friend who liked the post and wondered why he would bc maybe it was just a mindless thing  so he said he would talk to him  Again  Anna suggested he just doesn t bring it up and so he never did  This made me feel weird because he saw how hurt I was  yet listened to Anna instead of me    I am bringing all this up because I want to know whether I am just being sensitive about this or if I should bring this up to my boyfriend  I can definitely feel things too much and overthink  so if this is the case  please let me know and I ll work on it lol  Any advice I would really appreciate   Thank you

902,0,I m    M  desperately in love with a coworker    F  and I don t know what to do   A little background  I m    from a Middle Eastern country and a normal middle class family  our country is still holding on to some old school traditions so this bit is important   I started working at a Bank a little less than a year ago and has bern progressing well in my role  last October a new female coworker was introduced and I swear to God I felt like my heart skipped at least   beats when I first saw her    She s from a very prominent family in my country  her father is a former Minister and a globally famous lawyer as he served as a defense attorney in one of the most famous trials of the   st century    Anyhow  months went by and I tried chalking it up as just a normal crush that would just go away eventually  we d pass each other by from time to time and exchange simple pleasantries nothing more  I d notice her cheerful demeanor from afar and just keep to myself    Starting this month we started talking more a little bit  she s     she loves animals  she works out a lot  we have similar interests and life goals and just about compatible in every possible and imaginable way  we started exchanging emails to just pass time in a totally platonic and respectful manner    Every day passes by I find myself falling deeper and deeper and deeper in love with her  I d be minding my own business watching TV and my thoughts would wander to her  I d be working out with only her on my mind  I go to sleep thinking of her and as soon as I wake up she s the first thing on my mind and I can t wait to get to work so I could see her    I m not in a country where premarital relations are accepted and frankly what I want is to marry her   I d want nothing more in life than to be hers and have her be mine  I want to see her face everyday for the rest of my life  I want to go to sleep looking at her and wake up looking at her  I want to grow old with her see the world with her do everything with her    The problem is as anyone could deduce by now is our families social standing  Yes first I have to see if she s in anyway interested in me before I think of the next step but I can t help but feel like it s a hurdle I ll fall in  the traditions is that I d have to get her family to accept me and bless the marriage and without their acceptance and blessings nothing would happen  I m afraid they won t accept me  Even her being older than me can be seen as problematic in our society which is stupid as fuck but what can I do   Honestly even her rejecting me would be better for my mental health at this point  I ve been in emotional hell with no one to confide in  I know I have been borderline obsessive and that s not healthy and I think it s because of the massive uncertainty   What should I do  I need your advice  should I just lay it all on the line and let her know how I feel and whatever happens happnes  Should I wait and take it slow and see if there is interest from her side before I tell her and face her family s gauntlet if she accepts      
903,0,Should I continue to pursue my ex even after what I didAbout a year ago I broke up with my girlfriend of whom I d been dating for a couple of years  She was a great person  never cheated  extremely beautiful  etc  Well just before I broke up with her  her mother cheated on her father and got pregnant with the fling  This had a really hard effect on my ex  and turned to me to be the shoulder to lean on  I was fine with doing this because I felt like I loved her and hated seeing her so upset  Well the months went on and it soon became a problem  I was being her shoulder so much to the point where my problems didn t even matter  I couldn t voice my issues with her  tell her about how I felt or anything because she would always counter with how crappy things were going in her family s life  Eventually I got pretty fed up with it and decided to break up with her about last February         At first I felt really relieved to not have all that weight on my shoulders anymore  I hadn t been single in a while and it was a breath of fresh air  The air didn t last long though when I saw that she had started dating another guy  She told all of the friends that we shared how happy this new guy made her feel and how he had helped her out of the dark place she was in       After looking through photos of how much she had changed in just a couple of months and how happy she looked with him  I suddenly was hit with the reality of hat I had done  I had left the girl that I loved in a bad place for my own selfish wants       By then I was on rock bottom  trying everything to remove the guilt that I felt  Nothing worked and I just kept going  hoping that maybe time would heal it      Fast forward to about   weeks ago  I got the news that my ex and the new guy had split up  Upon hearing it I was suddenly filled with so much joy just thinking about talking to her again  Our shared friends gave me her info and encouraged me to do it so I gave it a try       She was pretty reluctant to speak with me at first  but as we kept talking she opened up way more  telling me about what had transpired with new guy and why they split and such  I comforted her the best I could and things seemed to keep getting better and better  We finally reached a really great point when us and a couple friends went swimming in the creek near my house  Just being around her and seeing her smile and laugh brought back everything that I knew I loved about her  I thought maybe things were going to change but then a couple days ago she all of the sudden got really distant for some reason  I tried talking to her but every time she gets really close again she backs off and acts different   I m just wondering if I m being a little to foolish into thinking that I d have a second chance with her after I was so selfish

907,0,Is it inappropriate for me    F  to seek emotional support from family members when in a relationship Me    F  and my boyfriend    M  have been together for    months  We live   hour away and see each other during the weekends  During the week I m at uni  My family  mum  dad and older sister  live around   hours away  and i see them around once or twice a month   A few days ago I was feeling very anxious about coursework deadlines exams  things related to uni  I get these moments  usually related to my studies  where I feel like I m having panic attacks  Me and my boyfriend facetimed and spoke about it on the phone  He was very nice and supportive  Then I said  I m going to call my mum  because she always has some solid piece of advice and just hearing her voice makes me feel better   I could tell from the tone of his voice that what I said hurt him   I m really grateful for my boyfriend s support  and the support I get from my mum doesn t minimise my boyfriend s  After the phone call with my mum  for two days my boyfriend kept rejecting my phone calls  kept saying  why only my parents matter to me  and  your boyfriend should be the only one that makes you feel better    I m also not allowed to go out past   pm   not even for dinner with female friends  who obviously now don t even invite me anymore    or go out without calling him first  and even during these two days where he wasn t talking to me I still had to let him know I was leaving my home in that moment  to do something random like the post office or the supermarket   For example  during these two days he kept rejeecting my calls  but got angry when he decided to call me back and I was outside of my home  he was like  why didn t you call me when you left home  even though i texted him that I had just left and obviously didn t call him anymore since he wasn t answering anyway  After two days of silent treatment  he asked me to promise me to never hurt him this way again  Although I may have used the wrong wording by saying my mum makes me feel better  I really didn t mean to make him feel excluded     Maybe it s cultural differences  I m from an Eastern European country  he s North African    So I ask  is it inappropriate to seek emotiomal support from family members in addition to your boyfriend when you re in a relationship   He s okay with me now but I m not sure how to avoid this in the future   TL DR Boyfriend is hurt that I said  my mum makes me feel better   is it ok to get emotional support from family members when you re in a relationship

914,0,Am I    M  too confrontational or are all my friends conveniently not confrontational at all Tl Dr at the bottom  I m simple with my friends  if I feel like someone in the group is being a dick or treating me or others unfairly I ll call them out and just say  don t be doing that   assuming  of course  others in the group recognise it s a problem that isn t just affecting me     The thing is whenever people ask me for advice with drama with their other friends I always say  tell them they re being a dick   or  bring it up with them soemtime   or  tell them how you feel   But they always tell me I m too upfront    I ll give a more specific example for clarity  so you can judge it a bit better  Recently a couple of my friends have been having girls nights and this guy keeps inviting himself along  being awkwardly pushy about it too  So my advice was  next time he asks to come just say no   When I was asked for advice in what they should do when he starts being pushy I said  just tell him he s not invited  reitterate that it s a girls night     They always give me strange  funny looks whenever I give advice like this as if I am somehow encouraging them to overstep a boundry  Of course I m not saying my advice is the best advice ever or that they even have to take my advice  but they all know how I give advice and still ask my opinion on it knowing the type of stuff I ll tell them to do  It is confrontational  I admit  but it s honest  I don t like this bitchy  behind people s back stuff so I prefer being upfront and that s why I give that type of advice   The example I gave is perfectly reasonable in my eyes  You don t want someone there  tell them they can t come  But they can t fathom the idea of being so direct and choose instead to have a lacluster time with him there  bitching about how annoying he is behind his back  when the solution to it all seems simple   Sure everyone s different and doesn t share my perspective but that isn t the problem  it s how they seem to view my perspective as way too  out there   which is a step above just disagreeing with it    What do you guys think of it  I m not sure what I m supposed to say if people keep asking me for advice like this  knowing what my thought process is   Tl Dr   If you have a problem with someone  tell them about it  is the baseline advice I give to friends who want my advice when they have drama  But I feel like they don t value that opinion  which is odd because I m always being asked for my opinion  despite them knowing what I ll say  essentially

918,0,Recent breakup and reconnection to an old love    help Okay   sorry in advance this could end up being a long one   For a bit of background I m    years old male but have been very sexually and romantically active since my teens    When I was    I met someone F     for simplicity let s call her Jane Doe who I fell in love with  we had our differences and we eventually broke up  it wasn t entirely mutual nor was it one sided  she wanted a break and I didn t and after the break I was too torn to get back with her even though she was clearly in pain and wanted to  Since then I ve had many flings and finally from       I was in a three year long monogamous relationship   During all these years I always thought about Jane despite there being numerous women to think about    During the   years we spent apart I still thought of her a lot  I thought of her more than any other ex and in fact she s the only one that would cross my mind  And before I entered a serious relationship we became very close again  we were having sex on occasion and hanging out when time permitted     When I met someone new I knew I had a choice  it was in my hopes that I would tell Jane about this person and she would object and we would end up together once more  But instead Jane told me to go for it and just like that we broke things off again   During my three year relationship I had times of weakness where I called Jane Doe  she would always be nice and we d have little chats followed by me not contacting her for months knowing it wasn t fair to who I was with  I longed for her even though it was unjust  and it was hard to not want to see Jane  but I didn t for all three years   Now  in present day I have been single for about a month and a half  I decided that all these unsolved emotions needed a resolution and so I contacted Jane to see if we could meet up for coffee and speak  On the phone   she explained that she feels I never gave myself the time to get over things and that she was able to while I was quick to jump into bed with others  I understood and she was still willing to speak with me as she felt it was something I needed   In all honesty   coffee and resolution were my truest of intentions and seems like they were hers too  Instead we both couldn t stop smiling  clicked immediately got closer and closer and ended up kissing  and spending the night in bed together staying awake all night through to the next day  It was as if after all those years she had also felt the same about me    As things stand now  we haven t placed or labeled anything  we haven t decided anything other than that we would like to see each other again and we vaguely told each other we would always feel a certain way about the other  Now my question is is this healthy  And if so or if not  is there any insight anyone can give me    I m terribly worried that I m doing something wrong  but it feels more right than anything  I feel as though my life was on hold and as soon as we were together I laughed like I used to and I felt like me again  It felt like things clicked in an amazing way but I can t help but needing some insight from unbiased sources  All my friends tell me if it feels right it s right  but I would like something more insightful as this is a huge step in my life I had only dreamed of  and now that it s a reality I m in a state of utter confusion

926,0,Was my friend cheated on Hiya    So in need of some advice     My partner and I were extremely happy with the relationship  I even asked him on Sunday if he was happy and he said yes he wouldn t change a thing    Monday after work  i thought about stopping by  wasn t going to see him all week and I was desperate for the loo  I pulled up  set one foot in the door to him having food and wine with another woman   Devastated   He ushered me out straight back out the house telling me I need to leave now  I asked she was and that I was only round for a quick wee  I tried to call him twice and left him a message    points of communication    He wouldn t tell me who the woman was and to simply leave  when I asked if he was cheating he said yes  Multiple times  after some swearing and a slap around the face I left    Later that night  I receive a message explaining that my partner is going to rent out the spare room and the woman was someone for consideration  At which point I felt awful  but failed to understand why he wouldn t tell me something like that  Pride and ego aside  surely you tell the person you love and have round most weekends something like that  Or maybe not    On the Sunday I found a condom wrapper in the bathroom bin  I m on birth control so no need for it  I asked him where it was from and he said from under the bed  Bit strange that there was nothing else dusty from under the bed  but I took the answer I trust him so thought nothing of it    Monday scenario happened  we are no longer together because he has has decided that he wants to be alone  A little odd considering on Sunday he was telling me how happy he was in the relationship    Since then it appears that he has posted screenshots of his online dating applications whilst we were together  Probably whilst I lay asleep next to him looking at the date and time    Do you think he cheated  Do I believe him that it s all innocent    Can you post to the reddit site under your domain please  As much advice as possible would be great  I stupidly still love the man    I feel that she has been cheated on but it s hard to tell  I didn t think he was the type of man to do that but I also didn t think he was the type of man break up with someone after his mess up and it be solely on his terms  Don t even know who he is it appears    Any advice for my friend so she can have a cry free day would be great   Thanks 
927,0,I am  m     Jealous of my GF  f     travelling with other guys need advice   Hello Redditors which give Relationship advice   First of all  we are in a lovely relationship so far which is   years old  My girlfriend of    years old went on a long vacation of   months to South America to travel and she is gone for   months already  Due to college  I could not join her but I am happy for her she can make her dream vacation trip   She is travelling mostly alone and sometimes with other people for good company  So far those travel buddies of her were always female and sometimes male female    However  in the last two weeks  she has been travelling with two guys she had met at a hostel  They are doing cook classes  hiking  musea and parties  Yesterday she told me she is going to go on a hike of   days with those guys  and probably some other tourists   and the Jealousy suddenly struck me hard  Also  I am jealous because the  rd day of the hike is my birthday and she will probably have no signal there  She told me she might not do the hike on my birthday because she thought it would be sad for me  I told her I could not give a good judgement about it since it is my birthday    I was thinking she might be cheating  She did cheat with her ex years ago once and that was spinning through my head  Even though I do trust her and I do not think she will cheat  I was thinking about it all day  She also got blackout drunk twice  I did not like that too much and told her to be safe  She is having a time of her life with those guys and not me which made me feel sad  All these reasons I give is because I m jealous at the moment and do not know how to react  They are probably all nonsense but the feeling is overwhelming   The thing is I have never been jealous before like this and I do not know how I should react  So far I have been encouraging her a lot to travel because she was scared to go to South America alone at first  I still want to be that encouraging boyfriend  But since     months ago she is enjoying her travels a lot and seeks less contact towards me  I talked about it with her and she said she was going text me back more    I have rambled for far too long now  but writing it down kinda feels good    The Question is what should I do  Should I tell her I am jealous she is travelling with those guys  Should I just keep it to my self and wait   month more till she is back  Should I say something she is going to a hike on my birthday even though I did not say anything about it when she asked   I do not know what to do  I don t want to be the jealous boyfriend and I also do not want her to enjoy her travels less because of me  Also  I still want to encourage her with her travels  I don t want to whine about everything  We are in a healthy relationship so far  I know she loves me and I also love her so much    Thank you dear redditor for reading my post and I hope you can give me some advice  Sorry if my English wasn t perfect since I m no native speaker     
928,0,My ex   F  messaged me   m  after a dream  LDRI was heavily hesitant on writing in this sub before i called her my ex  Maybe if i did things would have been different  I try to give some background    We met on okCupid  exactly a year ago   I m in europe she is in Asia  We both got attracted instantly and after our first fight we started calling it a relationship  Which was a bad omen already basing something mostly on looks  We would constantly fight  she would leave me hanging without even listening to me  At the time we met she also just got off an LDR    Anyway everything was good for a few months until on some collage school event which she asked my permission to drink  She kissed someone or as she claimed she was kissed and couldn t push him away quickly enough    I didn t talk to her for a week  i needed time to clean my head  eventually i decided to forgive her  which her told me she  felt dead and fucked someone in school because i thought i left her   she was is a virgin  and i thought she was joking  i kept pushing her to tell me it was a joke after days of fighting for the truth  i accepted it  and stopped talking to her for   more months  In the  rd month i went back to OkCupid  i found   other girls from the same place    started talking more and more to one of them while we drifted away with the other     The one who stayed the longer we talked started remindng me of my ex  so aftera a few weeks i got drunk  and messaged her again     It took a long while and a lot of effort  to make her talk again she was ashamed of her kiss  And said she told me that she lost her virginity as well to someone so i would leave her and this was her way of protecting me  and wanting me to be happy  after this i would be constantly wary of her every move that included guys  and she would get a ton of caters  And tell me that this and that asked her out  and she had this weird things like in the beginning i would see her on okc  she would even put her fb link on there  And we would fight about that  needless to say this is not something that normally i would put up with    but as the months went buy i was accepting her flirtish behavior and she did seemed to change      I believed her we got together again  we would still fight  she would try and push me away with various reason  including her family  studies etc  still have anxiety when she would message  and in the meantime the other girl i met become my friend  but she had more in mind  Which she told me directly but i was an idiot and didn t cut contact with her      At the beginning of january my gf said she didn t wanna be a teacher anymore which she studied in her collage and would sign up to be an officer in the airforce to support her family instead and flying was her dream anyway  I couldn t handle this  cause it meant she wouldn t be able to leave the country or talk to me for  month to a year  And of course would be surrounded by soldier boys    So i said we should stop everything which i didn t wanted to but secretly hoped she would change her mind if i give her enough time         A few weeks pass after this communication break and the other girl turns out stalked her information from the tid bits i told her about my gf  And messaged her on fb  And they started talking  which made my girlfriend message me and the   of them talking behind my back  My gf was furious she saw talking to her as cheating  which is understandable  i felt terrible guilt towards her and terrible hatred towards the friend      So i just left them both up until yesterday    My now ex messaged me saying hoping i am happy and she moved on and forgive for the both of us  and her reason to message me was that she dreamt about me  Then she randomly told me she would move to the US next year and she doesn t holds a grudge    Where it was pretty blatantly obvious she found someone  which i comfronted her and she told me she would come on april  th to visit her    I lost my shit since  She tried to tell me more and more things just so i would hate her and move on  she told me she waited one month for me to message her then  someone from her past came who  repaired  her and now she loves her how she loved me  And they gonna fuck when she visits she literally strongly hinted at that    great   and that they are gonna get engage all this under   months      Now at first i thought this might be her tactic from the past again making up shit to see my reaction  or really wanting me to hate me  but I m about     sure she is serious this time  and it s not one of her lies again  which then makes me wonder why in the world she would still message me and break that barely healed scar    And the most pathetic thing is that i still love her  and i can t move on and everyminute is pure torture especially when the silence of the night comes ever since this happened

930,0,How do you deal with conflict without being passive aggressive or silent I guess this is a general question  If it s not the right subreddit  I ll move along  I m just feeling worn down and frustrated   I m    years old and I don t know how to resolve conflicts  especially when they escalate  I grew up being berated  instead of debated   so my automatic reflex at someone being mad at me is to just shut down  I m mostly silent and will just take a step back and give in to whatever they re saying  or become just as scathing and defensive    I know that this approach might ve been my best option in the past  with people prone to abuse and violence  but it will end my relationships with people who genuinly love me  And I am loved   One recent example is that my partner    F  misunderstood things I had said over the span of several weeks  then exploded on me at once  She had misinterpreted my words completely  and I even understand and forgive her reaction  I was upset that she didn t give me the benefit of the doubt and stopped me when I said something questionable on the spot instead of assuming the worst   She apologized genuinely the next day and I accepted  but now what  She called me to see how I was the next morning also and her tone was happy  but I was still upset so I was dry  She closed the phone and we haven t talked in days  This has never happened before  I feel like I m losing her    How do you resolve conflict  How do you deal with an apology  and what comes after    Any input would be appreciated    
931,0,I need help letting go pleaseBackground  I m sorry if this is all over the place  I ve been with my boyfriend three years  He s an addict  he s cheated on me the last two years  broken me down emotionally  stolen from me and about six months in he started abusing me  He hasn t worked in almost a year and I ve been supporting him as well as myself and my children while he tends to his own needs  I m pregnant and that didn t even make him think twice about how and what he was doing  At one point when I first found out I was pregnant he even tried to talk me into getting an abortion that I later found out was only because he wanted to hide it from the girl he was cheating on me with  After the cheating came out and he couldn t deny it any longer  because I ve known the whole time but he gaslighted me into thinking I was crazy    I got a back bone and told him to leave  The problem is I always let him come back  He has begged and screamed and threatened and cried and swore to me that things would change  He moved back in with me and stayed home every day so I would trust him  Then he started back to being his normal self  Staying away from me and staying up all hours of the night and keeping his phone on vibrate  he only keeps it on vibrate when he is talking to someone else  going through my things and of course accusing me of cheating on him  He s pretty textbook when he starts cheating    I checked the phone bill and yes there were numbers he had been calling and texting and getting pictures from  I talked to one of the women and she apologized  saying she had no idea I existed  none of them ever have  and that they were really only friends  they ve all told me the same  but yes she had been sending him pictures and making plans to meet up with him because she liked him  When I confronted him he did the same as always  begged and cried saying I wasn t paying him any attention  all I did was sleep etc  I suppose he was telling the truth about that but in my defense and I have told him so many times  I m pregnant and it makes you exhausted besides the fact that I started on anti depressants when I found out about the first girl and one of the side effects was that it makes you tired  I was also so heart broken over everything from just   months before that honestly I needed time to heal and process what was going on in my life  He couldn t understand that  so he found somebody to talk to because he was lonely  There are days that I am so in love with him but I know deep down the him I m in love with isn t real  Then there are days where I think about how horrible he has been to me and how screwed up I am because of him and the trauma he s caused in my life and I feel nothing but pure hatred  I have been molested as a child and I was sexually abused by my ex husband and I still have never felt rage and hate the way I do for this man at times  I hate myself because I let him do this to me  I knew what he was doing but he would tell me he loved me and be so good to me but I guess that was to keep me where I needed to be  I used to beg him to let me go  I told him he was killing me and he had destroyed the person I was  The stress caused a lot of bad problems for me  I m not the same person I was before I met him  I will never be that person again and it makes me so angry  I used to be so happy and have a positive outlook no matter what the situation  My main problem though is that once again I got the guts to make him leave and normally where he would come to my house and beg me to forgive him and stay together and raise this family together he has stayed gone  I m thankful but part of me wants to call him and tell him I love him and to please come home  Why  What is wrong with me  I know he s no good  I know he will never change  I know he will keep hitting me  I know he will keep cheating on me  So why am I wanting him so bad  I mean in all honesty I m sure he s already found somebody s bed to keep warm because that s just how he is and I know this  Why am I tempted to even consider going through all of this all over again  Is this what codependents do and if it is how do I break this cycle  I m tired of feeling brainwashed

933,0,I    M  am thinking of asking my coworker    F  out to a movie this weekend  however I have no clue what im doing  I ve known her for      months by now and i think we get along really well  we ve often been scolded for talking to each other too much    I drive her home every now and then and I think I wanna try taking things a step further    A little background for me  over my teen years i was going through a really rough time in a bad place  and kinda convinced myself that ill never be able to develop a relationship  and that i didn t even want one  I just saw it as a waste of time    But as ive aged ive mostly moved out of that depressive stage but i kept that  I dont care about relationships  mindset  Lately  since meeting this coworker  im seeing things from another perspective    I never met anyone before that made me feel the way she does  I m not saying  she s the one  or anything like that  but shes the first one to ever make me think i want a relationship  The first one that made me think it might not be a waste of time     Anyway back on topic  weve both never had a partner before  both always lived the single life  We share a lot of common interests and we live pretty close to one another    My main concern is that shes just being nice and im mistaking that for flirting  Second concern is that i dont want to cause a awkward rift in our friendship inside outside of work  but i guess thats just a risk ill have to take  And third  ive never asked someone out before so if she  hooefully  says yes  I have no idea what to do   If anyone could give me advice on how to proceed i would very much appreciate it      Tl Dr im interested in my coworker and want to ask her out  but im not sure she feels the same  Even if she says yes  I have no experience and have no idea where to go from there    Thanks 
934,0,Is this normal So I ve    f   been together with my boyfriend    m  for   years  Today he showed me that he was going to buy hundreds of stickers of nude girls because it s hot and he wants to cover all of the walls in our computer room with it   I said that I don t want that because I don t seriously think it s  fresh  to have that kind of shit all over a room when you re    years old  have   kids and a gf    I don t want to be a party pooper but I just think it feels so strange that he would want such things CLEARLY VISIBLE for me and the kids to see what he enjoys     Now he tells me that the relationship isn t worth keeping because I don t  accept  hundreds of stickers of naked girls sucking dick and touching their boobs     am I wrong or how am I supposed to react to this    Any guys that can give me Input  I m not jealous and he can always do whatever he wants  it s starting to feel like he s pushing the boundaries to see how far he can go   but I think it s fucking sick   He fucked up real bad a year ago  hiding talking with a girl  and now this strange shit out of nowhere   Why would any of you guys feel the need to have a girlfriend that accepts that you have naked girls all over the walls  I think it s strange that it can be so important apparently
935,0,Me    m  and my girlfriend    f  are struggling with our first extended distanceSo I know there are more complicated difficult issues people are asking on here  but this has been really bothering me so I figured I d throw it out anyways  My girlfriend and I have been together for about six months  I m her first relationship  but she is my fourth  I  before her  have had some extremely rough relationships  one of which encourages me to self harm and would shame me for having panic attacks  I have bipolar   and an anxiety condition   My gal for the most part has been amazing with these things  I love her quite a bit and it s all great  Three weeks ago  though  she leaves for an exchange trip in France  She spends a week in Paris  then two in a small French town  When she is around her friends  she often gets aggressive and starts thinking like she s incredibly cool  For most of this trip  she s been fine  But the last few days  she comes back today  she s been flat out mean  My last week was awful  a test in every class  my spring break trip being cancelled for the first three days  and my dog dying  She has been super supportive and tried calling everyday during this  but the past two days she hasn t even seemed like herself  She s been mean and judgmental  She s been aggressive and tense  She gets super irritated whenever I ask if there s something wrong  but I m just trying to figure out if there is  She says there isn t  and a part of me knows there probably isn t and that I m creating something  but I don t know whether or not I should bring it up with her  She hasn t slept more than   hours in more than a week and has had to exclusively speak a foreign language for the past    Last night she didn t sleep at all  and her flight home got cancelled  she got rebooked   I ll see her in three days  Sunday   so I don t know whether or not to confront her as soon as she lands or wait until Sunday to cuddle and just see if it works itself out  My friends all are in favor of option    since they think that this is probably a reaction to the stress of returning home and the exhaustion of speaking another language and getting no sleep  Any advice  Thanks  
936,0,Good or Bad Idea to Send a Goodbye Letter to Ex I broke up with my boyfriend less than   weeks ago and it kills me inside to have made that decision  He was verbally and emotionally abusive  I also caught him on tinder  looking for a friend   I couldn t take the lies and the way he treated me anymore  We were together for a little over a year and we had some great times  Most of our time together was amazing  But I have to stay strong and not go back him  Here is a letter I may or may not send to him          I want to let you know that I don t hate you  I care about you probably more than I should  I have loved you for a long time and more than you ll ever know  And I will continue to do so    I lost a huge part of me by letting you go  You were my world and it s going to take a long time for me to feel whole again  You were a big part of my life so I don t want you to think this decision was easy  It s going to take a while until memories stop flooding my head every second of the day    I truly mean it when I say I want you to be happy  I want nothing but the best for you and I hope everything you dream of achieving comes to fruition even if I can t be there to celebrate your victories with you    You have no idea how badly I wish things could ve worked out  And honestly  I still do  But I think this is the best for both of us  I m sad things had to end this way  But I m happy to have loved you than to never have at all  I will cherish the many amazing moments we shared and I want to let you know how thankful I am that you came into my life    There is no one else I would ve wanted to travel the world with    I m not sure if it s a good idea to actually give you this letter  but I feel it ll be better to leave things as positive as I can  Don t feel like you have to acknowledge this  I just needed to let you know that my feelings for you were very real  I ve never dated someone and truly wished them complete happiness in the end   I ll miss you         All my love  xx

939,0,My    f  sort of kind of friend s    f  mom died a month ago  Should I chat her up with unrelated topics or give her space to grief We talked to each other about an hour  before her mom died  but I sent her my condolences only a week later because I didn t feel like I had the right  We re not even considered friends I think  just acquintances  but I do enjoy our occasional conversations  I feel like talking to her about her mom s death would be imposing too much  and I know we are not close enough to rely on each other for support   Should I chat her up again or just give her more time to be alone  Would she be annoyed  I don t know if this is the right word  if I talked to her at a time like this   What I m trying to say is  I know she s feeling horrible  but I don t know how she feels about social interactions  I want to talk to her again but I don t want to make her uncomfortable with any messages  
940,0,I    m  don t know what to do with my relationship with my GF    f  Me and my girlfriend have been dating for over a year and a half  It was a beautiful relationship in the beginning and has been until a few months ago  We moved in together around a year into the relationship  along with other friends  and it was fine  but then things started to get shaky  Im a cleaner person while she tends to be disorganized  She was letting things get really messy  like not doing her dishes and not cleaning up her messes  I usually end up cleaning them because I get tired of looking at them  and if I try to talk to her about it  she gets super defensive and calls me mean and comes up with excuses to get behind  Our other roommates have also noticed that she is being harsh and very short with me while I seem understanding and right in my views of situations  From what they told me  shes treating me quite a bit worse than I noticed  I was honestly surprised when they told me  Personally   I feel like I cant confront her about anything because she always gets angry and snaps at me when I do  So as a result  the place is a mess and borderline unsanitary  and the other roommates agree  I have felt recently that the relationship is loosing its spark and  I love you  is slowly loosing its meaning  and I am having a hard time seeing a long term future with her  Im finding that we are wanting different things in life and our views on things are going in different directions  We do have great moments together still  but Im just not sure if we were meant to last    I would really appreciate any help or advice that you may have for me to move forward    Thank you

944,0,I hate my GF s best friendMe     m   her     f    we have been dating for almost three years and lived together after   months which I know is fast but I got caught up in the connection we had  In the first year I tried to be as accommodating to her friend  lets call her Kelly  as I could  making plans around her and inviting her to all parties that we had  This is where I think the trouble started  she would come round and tell me to stop doing things in my own house  now granted these were just stupid things like tickling my gf etc but it started to grate on me  Kelly and my gf were inseparable and did everything together  mainly because Kelly is her only friend outside my friends  family and work  then Kelly got a bf and they stopped seeing each other as much which is understandable as your priorities change  However  it got to the point where Kelly would cancel plans at the last minute due to being too tired or her daughter was sick  then an hour later there would be FB posts of her and her bf out to dinner or doing other things    amp  x   B   This really hurt my gf and my perception of Kelly changed  I know saw her as flaky and just a shit friend to be honest  All of this encapsulated when Kelly got engaged  we were both asked out for dinner to celebrate with Kelly s family but I couldn t make it due to work and I think she saw this as a slight against her  My gf has tried to keep the peace between us and has forgiven her time and time again for her actions but it s not that easy for me as I learned long ago to cut toxic people out of my life but I did try     amp  x   B   Kelly and her then finac  broke up and things went back to normal with Kelly and my gf until she got a new bf  then we go round the dance again as above  it really got to my gf when they had plans a few weeks ago but Kelly s car wa sin the garage and couldn t get to town  even though she lives   minutes from the train station and its a    minute journey to the city centre  My gf accepted that she couldn t get to town or maybe due to her being in the garage simply couldn t afford dinner so let it go  The next post Kelly puts on fb is that she is with her bf in another city  close to where we live but a good hour on the train   This naturally really upset my gf and I dislike this girl even more because of how she makes my gf feel  its gotten to the point were just hearing Kelly s voice on the phone is like nails on a chalkboard  I even gave up a free holiday to Disney Florida instead of going with Kelly s family and my gf  as i knew I wouldn t be able to stand them for two weeks     amp  x   B   If it was just me then fair enough but my gf s family cant stand her either and believe she just uses my gf when Kelly needs a babysitter or has no one else to turn to  I know that it s really hard for my gf because she struggles to even get me in the same room as Kelly and I haven t spoken more than two words to her in over a year due to how she acts     amp  x   B   I really do believe that if my gf wasn t Kelly s daughters godmother they wouldn t be friends  how do I get over how Kelly acts and treats my gf to make things easier for her     amp  x   B   TLDR  GF s best friend is a cunt to her but she forgives her each time  how do I forgive her for my gf s sake  
945,0,Boyfriend thinks I m   f gayMy boyfriend and I have been together going on   years  I was    and he was    when we met  He was my first kiss  Now we have   kids  live together  and are committed   Today  we were talking about celebrities and I said  I dont think Post Malone is that attractive  Rihanna is though   He then asked me  very seriously  if I m gay  I told him that I m not completely closed to the idea of being with a woman but I m happy being with him and love him  He said that s not an answer  His reasoning is because our sex life isn t good  he thinks I want to be sleeping with women instead  and women  sometimes nude  are the main focus of my art    I m so offended and confused  I m only offended because it feels like he s blaming our sex life on me  even though he taught me everything I know   Confused because maybe I could be gay  I do find women attractive but I also like men  Confused because he seems so frustrated with me

947,0,Is this a major red flag    My    F  husband    M  sold his company and the first thing he bought was a         chainSo me and my husband have been married around   years  but dated   years prior before settling   He had a stable job in an office job as an accountant bookeep and we were doing farily decent  Enough to save like  k ish a month  all thanks to my husbands budgeting and penny pinching     years ago my husband ended up quitting and started up a Meal Prep Delivery service and instantly saw success  we live in a town where a lot of people are avid gym goers  compared to the norm    He ended up selling the company to another meal prep company for over   figures and he has no plans to work anytime soon as we don t have any debt or kids   Everything was fun so far  we took a much needed vacation for a week  Well the redflag popped up when he decided to go get a custom diamond chain made and it COSTED    K USD   When I saw it in the transactions I almost fainted and got mad  When I confronted him he became very defensive and told me  I never had shit growing up  and I always wanted a rapper chain     Coupled with the fact hes reaaaallly into rap music  even that mumble rap bullcrap like playboy cardi   I just dont want him to try and mimic a rapper lifestyle even tho he claims  I grew up poor  and I looked up to rappers  excuse  I feel like it could just feed into something bigger when it comes to spending money  or I m just reaching but idk its  am and i cant stop thinking abt it  Edit  sorry i wrote   k in the post  but that was the price of the HONDA he bought  adding to my point that ever since he got this money his priorities in spending may be going south for someone who budgets monthly  The chain is   k  Edit   for everyone pming main reason it even sold for over   figs was mostly due to the real estate  subscriptions  and social media presense in town The companies rep said it would have costed them more to start the business here because they would have to compete with us plus other costs such as real estate  chefs  facilties  all we had already set up and running  so accquiring the business made more sense to them

950,0,My     girlfriend     keeps searching for her ex on youtubeWe ve been dating since early December and things are going well  We both fell in love very quickly and are constantly talking and texting all day  Her last relationship was extremely toxic  she was with a guy for four years who was verbally abusive  He eventually end t up on hard drugs  and went to prison for a year  but not before knocking her up  For religious reasons and because doctors told her in the past she couldn t have kids  she decided to keep the baby  so now she is a single mom  She says to me she wants nothing to do with him and has blocked him from contacting her completely  she even moved to a different state  I don t think she wants to get back together with him  but her search history shows she searches and looks at his youtube playlists every couple of days  I believe her when she says she is in love with me and sees a future with me  but it really hurts to see she is still thinking of him and looking him up  His youtube is full of playlists  and a couple seem to be for her  He adds to them often  She s listened to   some   of the songs  As far as she s told me  he tried to message her on social media but she ignored deleted his messages  She also told me he sent two letters that she didn t respond to  I  did a youtube on her phone once and autocomplete came up with a previous search  addicted to your ex   I ve had a hunch about her not being over him for a while but everytime I mention it she denies it and gets a bit defensive  To her credit  it seems like every step of the way she is making sure to completely ignore him  reading the letters is not ignoring  but from his perspective she is completely ignoring him     amp  x   B   I know it can take some time to get over an ex  especially so with a baby involved  And I know that I ve only been with her for a few months and it takes time for things to settle  The bottom line is he is still on her mind a year later  If he is still on her mind  will he always be  It makes me mad and hurt  it feels like she is lying when she says she loves me and is over him  Am I overreacting  Should I call her out on her searches  I don t want to always have this other guy lingering on her mind for years to come when I am the one who is there and who she is with 
951,0,If I don t feel comfortable to tell anyone about him is it a bad sign This is my first time ever posting on reddit  I have another account I have been using for a while but the username has my name and I didn t feel like exposing myself hehe   My problem is that my ex is back in my life again  we re just hooking up so its nothing serious  but my story with him is quite complicated since the reason we broke up was because he ghosted me and then I found out he was dating another girl already  My whole family knew because I told them  and I hated him for a lot of time but then forgave him in order to let go my pain    Three years have passed now and we started seeing each other again  I sure am not in love with him but I am enjoying his company  so the problem is that I want to hangout with him but I m tired of making up excuses to everyone in my family whenever I am going to be with him  only because I feel very ashamed of hanging out with him after everything that happened  What should I do  Stop seeing him  Tell my family and not giving a fuck  PLEASE HELPPP

957,0,I ve moved out  but how do I move on when I still send him rent money every month for the apartment we have I m no longer on the lease  But I m paying my portion of just the rent until October because he wouldn t sign the roommate release unless I helped pay  Before you say I m retarded  this was my best option  My options were to sign roommate release which takes me off the lease and I m not responsible for it or stay on the lease and risk paying more or possibly all of his rent if he bailed out  So I did the roommate release  At least now I m not stuck with paying the full rent if he leaves or loses his job  So how do i move on from the break up when I still love him so much  amp  part of my check goes to him for the next   months    
958,0,Trust issues  baggage   amp  crippling anxietyHi everyone  I ll try to be as detailed as I can   I was in a great relationship for almost   years  but then we broke up last August because of misunderstandings and fights   which turned to fights about  we were on a break   and lies surrounding it  I admit we ve had our backslides but now I do feel that the pain and hatred has significantly diminished   But I can t feel the love for her anymore because of how fucked up the mess was that I don t think I d trust her again   Now I ve started to date again  This girl is nice  caring  and has no problems securing me even after I opened up about my issues and my past  She s been a real sweetheart who doesn t get tired of talking to me even when I get randomly paranoid  I know  it s not healthy  and I m working my way through it   My main problem now  to be honest  is her past  She used to be a wild party girl who takes party drugs  and also had a fuck buddy of   years  not frequently though  since she says he only calls her like twice in   months but she s down anyway  who she actually confessed to  just for fun    he turned her down  and that s when they stopped   I asked her why she did it for fun  and she told me it was because she was tired of being so casual and wanted to finally value herself more by being with someone who would care for her  Obviously  that s when I entered  We met I think   months after her last contact with the other guy  and around   months in our dating  she told me he reached out to her after knowing she was back in town  Initially I was surprised because she said she blocked him  but then I was frustrated as to why they were talking again and how he knew she was in town   It turns out she was a bit close with his other friends  so he saw through their social media  We had a small fight about it  mainly because of my anxieties and fear of being used lied to  but she promised me she s already blocked him and apologized for it  even though I told her she didn t have to    Now whenever I remember her past  it seriously just ticks me off  I m not sure if it turns me off  but all I m sure of is that it makes me feel uneasy how   Different she was in her past  I want to trust her and not judge her but I can t shake the feeling   Any insight is welcome 
959,0,I    F  have been dating my boyfriend    M  for almost a year  I m divorced and wanting to move on with life  he s a widower who is struggling with guilt and is very hesitant  Please help Let me start by saying that I love him and his daughters with all my heart  I ve been falling in love with him since our first date  He s an incredible man and a real life Prince Charming  He is all I want in this world    His wife died about   years ago  They met as teenagers  married young and spent literally every day of their lives together  I knew he was a widower when I met him and that I d need to be patient and understanding  I ve read a lot about dating a widower  but I don t know what to do right now  He cares about me  I know he does  but he doesn t introduce me as his girlfriend and he s not comfortable with being affectionate yet  I ve been ok with that  I never want him to feel pressured or rushed    We spent the holidays together  but it was awkward  I knew it had to be difficult for him but he was distant and kind of withdrawn  Our New Year s plans got cancelled at the last minute due to life stuff  and I was sad that I wouldn t get to celebrate with him  but he didn t seem too affected  Same thing on Valentine s Day   I got a  Happy Valentine s Day  text that morning  but our plans to meet for coffee got canceled  again  just life stuff  he s not blowing me off  and he didn t seem bothered by it  Then I mentioned I wanted to plan a something fun for our one year anniversary and he said he couldn t plan for that in case one of his girls needed him  He is an amazing dad and I get that his kids will always and forever come first in his life  I get it  I have kids of my own  I understand this        but       I don t feel like we re on the same page  I asked him what I was to him  and his response was  someone who I struggle with  emotionally   He s really having a hard time with guilt and grief and he feels like he s letting me down  I want more in the relationship  not sex  that s not what I mean  but I feel selfish even thinking about telling him that  because he s pretty clearly telling me he can t do that right now  correct  I can t imagine my life without him but I want to feel valued and important  It s weird because I ve been ok with waiting for him for almost a year  and I m not sure what s changed  but I can t be a weekend girlfriend anymore  He knows something s going on and I m seeing see him later tonight  I don t even know what I want to say  I want to tell him that I love him but I don t want to scare him  I want to tell him that his wife would want him to be happy but I don t want to sound preachy or cliche  I want to tell him how much he means to me  but     does that just put more pressure on him  I m not trying to give him an ultimatum like  step up or I m gone   but I also don t want to wait for another year and have him turn around and tell me he just can t date  you know  I don t even know   Can anyone make sense of this  What do I tell him later  Do I have to accept that we re in different places and decide if I should keep waiting or not    
960,0,My wife    F  of two and a half years told me she no longer desires me    M Sorry for the long post ahead  I am just really lost and confused right now and tried to work through everything in my text   My wife and I have been together for twelve years now  married for two and a half  I always thought we were very happy with each other  we make each other laugh a lot  we always have something to talk about and almost never fight  Our friends and family always say we are the perfect couple  because we always have each other s best interest in mind and until today I wholeheartedly agreed  Lately however  my wife has been quite down and a bit distant  She suffers from depression and gets like this from time to time  so I did not give too much thought to it but just tried to be there for her the best I could  There were some weird changes in behavior as well however  for example  she recently stopped sharing her location with me on her iPhone  which she had complained about before   and discussing having a threesome recently after we had sex  saying that it could be good for us to experiment together  I was her second serious relationship and she was my first real girlfriend  so she had talked about being worried that I would miss out on other experiences before  She also recently told me that it was ok for me to flirt with other women  if they hit on me  I had told her that I saw a girl checking me out at the gym   This evening I was hanging up the laundry to dry and saw that she had bought two sexy new panties  So  I half jokingly said to her that there were more and more clues that seemed as if she was having an affair  no location sharing  suggesting threesome  new underwear    So  I asked her if everything was alright and if she was still happy with me  After a slight pause she told me that while she still loves me very much and is usually quite happy with me  for some time now she has not been feeling attracted to me physically  Instead  she said that lately it felt as if I were her brother or another close acquaintance and not her husband    At first  I was obviously very hurt by her comment and did not know how to react  So I asked her if she felt attracted to other men  or did not feel attracted to anyone at the moment  which can happen with depression   She said that she did feel attracted from time to time to other men  I then asked her if they were funnier than I am  were better looking or fit  or more intelligent than me  She said that it was mostly physical attraction related to their looks  This was a double blow to me  since I recently started going to the gym and running somewhat regularly and started putting on muscle and losing fat  My wife even commented that I was looking fitter the last few weeks  I was not fat or even chubby before  just regular looking and not very athletic  while now I look a bit leaner and more fit  So her losing interest in me physically when my looks are actually improving was doubly shocking   We stopped our discussion because I had grown silent and my wife headed to the shower  So  I started googling attraction in long term relationships and found lots of articles talking about women becoming less attracted over time due to routine  So  after her shower I asked my wife how we should go about remedying the situation  and if she for example wanted to do the mojoupgrade list with me  website where each person can indicate kinks or fetishes and if both picked something it shows up   She said no and that she hoped it would just go back to normal on its own  and that this might just be a phase  She also said that maybe this is just what happens in long term relationships over time  However  I refuse to believe that  since I still love and desire her just as much as ever  At that point I told her I had to clear my head and that I would go for a run  While I was running I kept debating things with myself  oscillating between anger  hurt  confusion and self pity  I was very unsure about how to react going forward  whether to be angry and lash out  or if that was counterproductive and actually harmful if she was just feeling distant because of depression and would snap out of it  When I came home  my wife was already asleep and I had a glass of wine and started going on relationship subreddits   I have been reading through reddit threads by both people who s partners lost attraction to them  as well as people who lost attraction to their partners and the general consensus was that this was the death knell for the relationship  Do you think there is still hope  or am I just in denial  I keep thinking that it might just be my wife s depression  which has caused her to become distant to me before  one time even breaking down and telling me that I deserved someone better  whom I could be happy with   She said she has talked about this to her therapist  but that the therapist has not suggested any course of action to her yet  Would you pursue couples councelling or do you have any other tips for me  Right now I am just left reeling and don t know what to do  
961,0,Me  m    have forgotten how to talk to my  F   wifeWe ve been together for   years and until recently i thought we had a great marriage  but turns up we ve grown apart and i didn t even realize it  I spent all my time doing things for her so she didn t have to  like laundry cooking cleaning etc even looking after her   horses when shes too busy with work  But i forgot about the little things like just talking to each other about random bullshit making her laugh etc  And now shes unsure if the love is still there for her well she knows she loves me shes just not sure if shes in love with me  But the problem is I ve finally come to realize what an idiot I ve been  but now i have no ideal how to get back what we had  its like i lost all my confidence and just don t know how to have a simple conversation anymore  Any advice anyone can give in how to help me get my confidence back would be greatly accepted 
962,0,Me     M  after breaking up with ex GF     F  feel back stabbed by common friend     F I was with my ex for   years and she broke up with me   months ago  We had some issues but nothing too serious  apparently   A little over a year ago  we started to get along with Jackie  Jackie is apparently a nice girl  A bit too loud and causes a bit of drama   At first I was wary of her  I just couldn t put my finger on it but I couldn t trust her  My ex adored her  I was specially bothered when she came on to me a couple of times  Eventually I convinced myself it was all in my head  and maybe it was   I know I never felt comfortable describing those events to my ex  I never felt the slightest temptation to stray with her  I was always      loyal   Jackie is apparently a very nice person  She s attractive and guys immediately notice her  I never got that  But  also  she s too loud  She talks too much and makes everything about her  Her love life is a train wreck the worse I ve ever seen  She would often complain men were bastards and not realize she would invariably gravitate towards the worst kind of men  Numerous times I confronted her with this  This culminated with a guy that was playing with her for months  My and my ex warned her over and over about him and she would end up in a backseat with him every time  In the end she got pregnant and the guy disappeared  She had an abortion and I had to be the one to be there for her for doctor appointments  procedure and support  I was pissed off but had no heart to leave her hanging during such an ordeal   Now that me and my ex are over I ve realized a few things  She contributed heavily to the end of our relationship  Intentionally or not  She would often throw observations that would make my ex insecure about the relationship  Some of our biggest fights started with seemingly inoffensive remarks from her  including the final were she ended up breaking up with me  I can clearly see now the downturn in our relationship coincided with her starting to hang with us  the   of us  yes   She even went on a vacation with us because my ex insisted  I ended up feeling like the  rd wheel and we had our biggest fight  by far  during that vacation  All because she mentioned the   of them would be spending a day together  leaving me alone on vacation all day  My ex hadn t even agreed to that  But she couldn t put her foot down  was very harsh and rude to me and dealt with the situation horribly  She also insisted I should apologize to Jackie for making her feel uncomfortable  In the end we made up  but I can see now our relationship was damaged irreparably after that fight   When we broke up Jackie said she was there for me and became the only road of communication between me and my ex  which I soon cut off   She insisted I could count on her for venting and would make sure I wouldn t have to cross paths with my ex  as was my wish   She insisted my ex wouldn t be looking for another relationship soon so I wouldn t have to worry about crossing with her and the new guy  I was clearly the one who was hurting more of the two and she was friends with both equally  I believed her at first  Soon I started to realize the negative influence she had on the relationship   This week she started filling Facebook with pictures of my ex  unidentified without any warning  I was doing good and suddenly my feed was full of pictures of her  She never posted pictures of them on Facebook  Now they re everywhere  Pictures of the two of them taken by her male friend  And I know she s trying to get them together  Less than a week ago we were having coffee and I was venting how I was dealing with the whole break up  Less than   months after it all  I impulsively blocked her and she hasn t realized that   Sorry for the venting  I m slowly starting to get better but I m still in a bad place  Am I seeing too much in this or is Jackie really not who I thought she was   TL DR  Broke up with GF of   years  Common friend may not be my friend at all

976,0,I already posted in a different community  but I need as much help as I can get  if y all don t mind 
977,0,Game over  she s engaged   I wrote a question earlier  maybe a month or so ago     I had to delete it and my account  sadly  because I suspected someone may have figured out it was my account IRL       The TLDR of that post was that I m severely handicapped  live with my parents  can t drive  need help eating  getting in out of bed  and using the bathroom   I have a female  best friend  whom I work with for the last     years   Early on in our relationship she said I was like the  brother  she never had   I was not attracted to her romantically way back then   Eventually we spent a lot a lot a lot of time together at work  I started seeing her in a different way   Six months ago she confided to me teary eyed that I m her best friend in the whole world and she wouldn t know what to do without me   Lately  she was unhappy bored with her current boyfriend so we decided we would start going out on  friend dates   always dutch  no hand holding  etc     I was madly in love   The consensus of the responses was to not tell her anything   Either enjoy the friendship and give up my feelings or back away from her   I was going to go against this advice and just tell her and see what happens   I had been working out speeches and scenarios on how to do this for the last couple weeks   Here s the new twist  but some background first   About five years ago she broke up with long term boyfriend  Boyfriend X   they were together at least    years  I met him  he seemed like a okay guy except I knew the truth   She loved him deeply but he treated her badly at times  nothing physical   wouldn t commit  cheated   at times aloof  mind games  he d use her credit cards without permission  etc until she got sick of him and broke up  several times  Typically after a breakup Mr  X would endlessly call or text and eventually she would give in and go back   Things would be good for a few weeks until she would be miserable again   Lots of tears and lots of drama with her mainly leaning on me for support   Despite being super in love with him she finally just couldn t take it anymore  During this breakup  the  big   breakup   which took months  I started seeing her in a different way   I was proud of her when she finally ended it because she was so sad with him for the preceding year and she she seemed happy again   Around this time my then infatuation turned to love   I started thinking she deserves better and we would make a great couple if she could accept the wheelchair and all my baggage    and I started to wonder daydream    big mistake  I wanted to tell her I had feelings for her after this breakup but losing the friendship and screwing up my job if she or I couldn t handle it stopped me   Plus I wanted to give her a lot of time between the breakup and any overtures   Not too long later  a new boyfriend  boyfriend  Z   comes along and I am dying inside    I missed my chance  Five years of sadness and depression set upon me  She doesn t catch on as I am Mr  Cheerful around her and Mr  Bummer everywhere else   My parents pick up on my sadness and since I won t tell them why  they suggest therapy  I ask my family doc about it and despite a referral I never follow up   Whats the point in life if one is going to be alone for the rest of it    but thats a different reddit   Anyways  a couple months ago  at dinner  she tells me she s really tired of boyfriend  Z   I really refrain from giving her too much advice on her love life because I ve seen her break up and go right back and I don t want to be on the wrong side of that equation  Plus I have a conflict of interest she doesn t know about  I can t tell her he s a jerk  break up with him  and then ask her out the next week   I just tell her to trust her gut and only be with people who make her happy  Finally after a couple months she s had enough of Mr Z and calls it quits   This was LAST week    like   days ago  I m thinking maybe after a couple weeks I should just tell her I have feelings for her but if she doesn t feel the same  let s keep the friendship  blah blah blah    Something along those lines as I have been running speeches and scenarios of how to do this since she told me her and Mr Z were on the skids  I was     sure it was going to be  I see you as a friend  response  but I am at a point where I need to know  Just let the chips fall where they may   Yesterday she shows up to work with an ENGAGEMENT RING  I say  Wow  Huh  Mr Z     and she says  No and please PLEASE don t be mad   Apparently boyfriend X showed up at her doorstep and proposed   I knew he had been  checking in  with her since the  big  breakup but she said she was ignoring his texts because as she says  a zebra doesn t change his stripes   At one point  sometime around the holidays  he sent her a ten page text telling her how his life has been horrible and incomplete without her and he pleaded for another chance  She told me at the time she ignored it  but that it did affect her   In any case  she thought about this surprise proposal for a couple days  again  I m in the dark despite the  so called  BFF status  and says  Yes     I m sure she doesn t tell me because she knows I know how he treated her and probably didn t want a reality check on that   Besides her parents  I m the first one she tells  not brothers or sisters  aunts  cousins  nephews  nieces or other friends  but ME   I say  Congrats   but I am dumbfounded inside  Mr X  Really  The guy who treated you so badly  I find the timing uncanny as she had JUST broken up with Mr Z and three days later Mr X proposes     Anyways  I m numb all day yesterday and I m sure she notices but I don t care  I m not engaging  no pun intended  with her at all and I m really unable to concentrate or work  She leaves work and sends me her usual  See ya tomorrow   text and I send her a lukewarm response  Eating dinner with my parents and they can tell something s wrong   I m devastated and I finally spill the beans  They say she obviously  likes  me and I should tell her now  before its too late  and I m thinking they are crazy     I called in sick today    amp  x   B   There are really two separate problems   My secret love for her but her also her getting back with Mr X of all people   I really do think he is bad news unless he really has  changed his stripes    What do I do   Be Mr Cheerful and act happy for her   Be Mr Cheerful but ask her if she s sure about this and have the ensuing conversation   Or do I be Mr Truthful and tell her my true feelings about her   Other options    I m not sure what my options are now that she is wearing an engagement ring    amp  x   B     edited for formatting  
978,0,An I an abuser  Is the  compensation  just Hi guys   So me and my girlfriend were together for around    months before we broke up and I would just like any opinion  advice on how to handle things going forward   My GF was studying in Germany at the time  and I was working in London  Fast forward  and its march      and i saved some money and moved to Germany  We had an argument and we both agreed that as a sign of commitment Id make the jump  I did  I saved for a few months and quit my job  no real career prospects anyway  alas  i found a job in Germany  It was an office job  and I was travelling   hours to and from work each day  so thats   hours in total per day  It was pretty terrible  but in the name of love  i persisted  Fast forward   months  i paid for a new kitchen  washing machine  and other things  At that time       people were made redundant  and me being the newest recruit to the team  of course I had to go  My German was minimal so finding another job was tough  At last  I couldnt afford to pay the rent  and I had to return to the UK as we split up after an argument   My argument was let me miss rent this month  return to the UK  and pay my share while my Gf would continue to live there  She would not accept not paying the rentfor a month  so the last   weeks we didnt speak to eachother and I returned and began to look and find work immediately  Bear in mind by this point  I was in my over draft and had to loan money from family just to pay the rent for the month because she didnt want to miss a payment  So I return to the UK about        in debt   Upon splitting up  my GF failed some assignments and it was clear she would need to do an extra semester at university so she requested that if I want to make amends for  all my mistakes  i should at least pay her the sum of       as compensation  This is for her wasted  time   rent  therapy  tuition  and general living expenses for a semester  At first I agreed  then I said thats too high  then I agreed again   Our communication from when I returned to the UK went on for about     months and consisted of me apologising and explaining while she hurled abuse at me  She justified her abuse because of all the mistakes I done    Should I pay her the full amount    She also called me an abuser because I kicked a pillow  i was on the couch and the pillow was next to my leg  she was far from both myself and the pillow  and called her a bitch  I never swear  but at that moment I lost control because she suggested I ask my younger sister for the money  I have been extremely self dependant growing up so asking family for money was very difficult for me  I did it anyway the following day  Does she have a right to label me an abuser and post things on her social media about  abusers   clearly referring to me   Its not the first time shes tried to embarrass me on social media    Its been a few months since I last spoke to her  the last time being her sending my stuff back and saying its the last  mercy  she will give me  I didnt respond    I have paid a total of       to her already  Edit  I    M  and her    F

981,0,My    F  boyfriend    M  doesn t think he s handsome and I want him to believe Before I start  I won t share pictures of him without his permission so you ll have to trust me   In highschool I had the biggest crush on the guy  I just thought he was the most handsome person I d ever seen in my  life   in addition to being super cool and interesting and smart   I digress   I ve told him so  When we started dating in   th grade  I thought I had won the lottery  In the   ish years we ve been dating  though  he never really believes me when I compliment him  He believes that  I  think he s handsome  but I always get the feeling he doesn t think he is good looking outside of that   Like  his friends joke about how handsome he is but they joke so much that when they genuinely tell him  dude  you look good  he thinks they re still joking  Girls give him looks all he time  even when I m with him  and he  notices  but he thinks it s because there s something off about how he looks  People compliment him sometimes too but he thinks they re just being nice or making fun of him    He s struggled with being bullied for his looks before  he s always fixing and adjusting his hair because he was teased for it so often  I only recently convinced him to grow his hair out again in but a different style than when he got bullied for it  it looks fantastic and he has the softest hair ever   I also helped him update his wardrobe and he now has a ton of clothes that look better on him than the old t shirts and jeans that were once      of his closet  He knows his outfits look better but just won t accept that he s what s making the clothes look good  not the other way around    Reddit  how do I convince him that he s good looking  
982,0,Is it worth breaking up with my BF    M  over this  I am    F I m a Middle Eastern girl  and he s white  When we first met  he told me he d never date someone of my race but he thinks that I m cool  I thought it s whatever  he can be attracted to whoever he wants  Eventually  he asked me out and I said yes  We ve been dating for   months now   Last night  we were hanging out and he jokes that  it s nice to have a submissive woman around   because I come from a traditional family  I didn t think it was funny  I told him that he s being racist and disrespectful  He told me to lighten up and I m being petty over nothing  Is it rational to break up over this or am I being too petty 
983,0,Should I    f  be worried about my boyfriend      and his coworker    f  My boyfriend and I have been together on and off for a long time  almost ten years now  We were split up for a while but have been together semi long distance for the last six months    A couple of weeks ago him and a few of his coworkers had a party and I wasn t there but a friend was and they told me that he basically spent the whole night talking to a coworker  she s been at the company for about   months  she s     and they don t work together closely but it sounds like they have a lot in common and get along well when they so work together    From what my friend said she was fairly drunk at this party and once she finished the beers she brought for herself my boyfriend gave her some of his  And they played some drinking games together too  I wish I could have seen how they were acting together but I wasn t there and all my friend really said was they were sitting together on the couch talking most of the night  and that when he left she hugged him a few times  I don t know if that s just because she was quite drunk though    I don t want to bring it up and make an issue of something that s not an issue  but I also can t help but be a little concerned  I don t even know what she looks like but she s young  apparently she s very smart and well liked at the company  and thinking about my boyfriend spending the whole night talking to her does make me a bit uncomfortable  Should I be worried
